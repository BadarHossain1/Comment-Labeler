oh thank god ai is only taking jobs from recent college graduates and entry level positions i was worried that the poor innocent upper management and stakeholders would be affected
we had layoffs at my company of the guys laid off came back two days later as a contractor because there was no one else available to do the work we needed him for an upcoming shift and he said he wasnt available as he was a contractor now and working for another company that day the loss of that one shift cost the company half a million what a legend
it was greenwashing in s now its aiwashing in
ai should be able to take over ceo jobs if anything
its not just ai the goal is to devalue labor so people would accept lower wages the ai capabilities or capacity has been heavily overstated
this analysis is spot on the comments these folks make is accurate it helps with tasks coding writing researching but cant really do an entire job it cant even do customer service
corporate greed and a convenient excuse that blindly boosts investor confidence
i was told im being laid off im not sure if i was laid off because of ai but im certain that its becoming harder to get hired due to ai ai auto rejects many applications
its good to see that some main stream outlets arent completely bought into the ai hype liesman was right theres a lot of assumptions be made about ai replacing jobs that simply isnt supported by the evidence there are far more structural economic reasons for why layoffs subdued hiring are happening right now
so companies are so concerned to admit publicly that the economy is in bad shape in fear of government abusive pressures that they are now blaming ai omg how can we solve problems when we keep creation illusions out of fear andor corruption
i agree that generative ai is enhancing human capabilities rather than replacing jobs most of the layoffs were seeing today stem from economic or structural factors not from ai itself in fact organizations that embrace ai responsibly are finding new ways to boost productivity and create roles that didnt exist before
this is the problem when have stockholders that dont know anything tell you how to run your business running the economy to its lowest just to get a return on investment
read the cnbc website article on this this morning i was wondering when the video will drop thanks
how about replacing the management layers with a i and letting the workers stay might be an improvement
i use ai every day its a glorified search engine not anywhere near what they are advertising i spend more time trying to get it do what i need than it would take me to do it myself and you spend your whole life cutting out fluff and fill words to be direct and precise and it fills the page with crap to try and sound smart
been saying this for the longest anyone who has ever worked in corporate america knows that of all the jobs are bs you spend most of your day sitting around or in pointless meetings the only time of business is when the occasional project comes along this was the case way before ai
this analysis says companies are using ai as an excuse for layoffs the video argues that businesses are really just hurting or bloated and they only say ai to make their stock price go up this misses the main point the business isnt hurting by accident it is hurting because it is spending billions of dollars to buy the new ai systems the layoffs are not an excuse they are how they pay for the ai this is the definition of wage compression companies are trading the high cost of human workers for the high cost of new machines the goal is to replace the human worker permanently or at least the vast majority of human workers
layoff due to ai layoff due to robot layoff due to internet layoff due to computer layoff due to automation layoff due to globalization layoff due to global warming layoff due to oil running out layoff due to
i like how they interviewed john challenger and not john defender
ai costs a lot from employee salaries to building the necessary infrastructure unfortunately to cover these expenses some companies end up cutting other jobs shareholders are hoping interest rates will drop so businesses can borrow more money to fund their ai projects and if those projects fail it wont be the shareholders left holding the bag itll be the k accounts of ordinary workers
im a dev working with ai its not replacing anyone this is a recession due to rates tariffs trade wars and other factors the main streams will lie till we dont buy it any more and thats what this video is discovering news like the main stream media can do that in the first place
i have actually been wondering for a while now since hearing stories in the past months regarding layoffs relating to ai thanks for posting this cnbc
tldr ai has been massively overhyped and bosses are simply using it as an excuse to sack people they wouldve anyway
amazon did lay off tens of thousands because of ai just not because ai is doing their jobs quite the opposite really they laid all those ppl off because they need to spend billions buying the equipment to bring their aws up to speed in regards to ai compute without dramatically affecting cap ex ppl keep talking about how it looks like they were wrong about ai taking jobs when the reality is the infrastructure to run the kind of ai needed to take those jobs doesnt even exist yet
its not just ai its the whole economy i was let go after my government reports made my boss look bad and the local businesses said theyre not hiring because tourism is way down and buyers arent buying
theres a reason why japanese companies survive so long they dont do layoffs as much as western companies the employees feel safe and some even work in the same company their entire lives
the propaganda began diffusing blame its the ai not the ai its the ceo not the shareholders etc and in the end the common man will pay for all this and hell blame whoever he likes less
if you think ai creates jobs press if you think ai creates wellpaying jobs press if you want to hear the choices again press
it should not replace but it should make individuals more productive thus decreasing number of headcount
ai isnt replacing workers its replacing excuses the system learned how to make profits without people
year finally we got rid of all the employees jeff bezos
if you compare it to the internet itll take another to decades to really hit its stride meanwhile a i will begin to take entry level jobs and companies will cease hiring entry level employees to save money then their senior employees will begin to retire and there will be no one with experience to replace them
ai is the new return to office excuse a coverup for leadership failures behind layoffs and an attempt to make employees quit it still struggles with basic math yet were told it will transform company profits maybe ai will be truly effective one day but that day isnt coming anytime soon
yes however jobs and businesses are getting gaslight with people telling them well you better get ai because youre going to get left behind everyone is using ai why arent you ect ect i think people should stop pressuring people of what they need to invest in this or else thats whats driving the firings projecting the last guy said it right
its just used as a scare tactic ai is not calling people to be fired
i work in corporate our company had layoffs earlier this year ai isnt a direct use for my department but management told us start learning how to use it as our department arent directly threatened by ai but the threat will be others that know how to use ai
companies are firing en masse because they over hired in that doesnt make the layoffs any less painful and not being ai related doesnt mean they are going to stop i had two people laid off from my team just last week
ups and amazon both are also due to consumer slow down they both have massive capacity increases during covid they are definitely trimming excess capacity from covid recovery
imagine if all of america used ai rather than a real person on any job good luck with the results
there are two reasons why big cos attribute layoffs to ai because the market will reward any evident sign of ai led efficiencies to beat down labour selfesteem and bring down how much employees value themselves if staff think they can be easily replaced by ai theyre much easier to manage
i think these companies are letting people go to gear up for a recession also i think theyre going to regret a lot of these cuts because of unfavorable demographic and education trends
ai wont buy products on amazon or wallmart or starbucks ai wont buy houses we all know where this is going
there are going to be jobs cut because of ai when the bubble bursts and everyone realizes they have spent way too much stocks are going to crash and they will need to cut jobs its not going to be because the chat bots stole your job
when the person is let go no ai or other person is replacing them its all for cost cutting
the venn diagram is perfect everybody should use it more often great content
robots should be treated like foreign workers before an employer can hire a robot they should first demonstrate that no human could do the job then they should apply for a licensevisa that would need to be renewed on an annual basis the revenues from the licensing should be reseved to provide bridging finances for workers and businesses that have been replaced by ai and robots
get funding and cut jobs and then whenever u actually build better ai you keep cutting jobs ask for bailout ifwhen it crashes true quantum computer and tue agi will not be positive things
i work for tech you know how many over hiring they used to do like marketers for one project they did nothing all day companies are now beginning to maximize what they actually need especially tech fb amazon google they all fired these extras we were living in a tech bubble where tech companies were hiring for no reason ai is just a small tip in the iceberg
why is no one reporting on what the gov is doing with all the revenue it receives since not being distributed these funds are accumulating
not a single job has been replaced by ai yet but it may replace some jobs in the future ai another indian american companies are employing more people in india than in the usa
ai is just like prior technologies like automation machine learning data science etc makes peopleorganizations more productive and only replaces some lowskilled human jobs ai will not take all human jobs
i always laugh when people say ai will take peoples jobs given that were still at the abc stage of ai its too early to worry as were still building data centers and training models alot of people who claim ai will take jobs just dont seem to understand what ai is all about
this is more evidence that we are not in the ai age but in the age of accelerated transformation multiple variables can be found in political economic societal technological legal and environmental drivers of change that converge to create these layoffs ai is undoubtedly a contributor but it is not the sole factor driving the acceleration that necessitates organizational transformation
ai has become the perfect cover story for companies who want to lay off workers the market will see your use of ai as evidence that youre becoming more productive and because youre cutting workers youre lowering costs and hence becoming more profitable the stock market loves both of these things
al is the next rto just a new excuse for cutting jobs as a computer engineer i only code of my time and its mainly querying the database it takes way less time for me to just query it myself than explaining it to ai and spending time to debug the code that said there are specific cases where ai can improve my task a lot when it is repetitive
ai layoff in tech is the new codeword for h b
agi is fusion only years away every years
its less embarrassing for corporate management to blame layoffs on socalled a i then to admit they are incompetent and hired too many people in the first place
ive been saying this for a while but people dont believe me then this video came into fyp
anybody that says you dont need so many levels of mgmt has never worked in a huge complex corporate obviously some people should be fired low performers or toxic people but those reporters cant even start to comprehend how many different teams i have to deal with on a daily basis in a huge corporate
so let me get this straight companies have invested ungodly amount of money in ai and the payoff is not there and now they have to fire people to pretend ai is replacing them i am a free market guy but i really think government should intervene and brakeup all monopolies this ai bubble is going to take down the entire economy like the crisis why do we have to suffer because rich people are losing their money from bad investments
as a spreadsheet jockey and ai skeptic i dont actually see it taking jobs completely but it along side many technological advancements dramatically improves productivity this argument of will or wont ai replace workers distracts from the question of whose lives does the productivity gains actually improve like everything else its likely to go directly towards lining the pockets of executives and wall street enough is enough productivity gains and worker wage growth should move in tandem not productivity gains and wealth inequality
ai is hitting some tech and call center jobs the most which is a pretty small part of the job market what is really destroying jobs right now is low productivity in the economy due to a combination laziness and a greedy government that has printed too much free money making people feel like laziness is their only option against a declining economy
her explanation makes sense a whole lot of sense blaming ai for bloatedness is an easy out
layoffs dont matter to employees as long as the stock prices are rising most of them are happy to sell their stocks with thousands percentage returns take the severance package and not have a boss for a lifetime
people used to look for the right tools to make work more efficient and more profitable for the company these days ive been seeing companies having a shiny ai tool and making people use it for whatever work they do even if that makes the job less efficient and poorly done
the best documentary i have seen on ai and it makes sense as well in my industry telecom there havent been a single layoff attributed to ai
for the big tech laying off people its a result of over hiring in recent years trying to be the first in ai breakthrough at all cost and now cutting back to hopefully offset a little bit of the huge ai infrastructure investment
theres a fundamental problem with robots and ai which is although there is an obvious reduction in the need for employees theres also an increase in unemployment and which company is going to have an improved bottom line if they dont have customers
restructuring a k a your position has been eliminated are just tactical excuses that make it impossible for employees to pursue legal action against the company so any attempt at an informed discussion that shows this on a piechart etc should acknowledge that most of the restructuring is aimed at reducing at head count to shore up company coffers enabling reports of profits and dividend buybacks and reducing operating costs ai is now the stepsibling of restructuring you can effectively merge these two bubbles when reporting wielding ai effectively requires substantial businessdomain expertise for most businesses
ai is just the excuse that investors will believe the one guy is right no way ai is causing this because it takes a lot of time to implement
its all about short term winnings and stock going up most ceos do not last years in a company most stock holders do not hold more than a few years too so profits over everything ceos want the fat bonus company going bankrupt tens of thousands with no job who cares we made money
bro the companies are saying it themselves amazon literally said they are laying off people and are going to use ai
notice how apple is the only big tech company thats not affected by mass layoffs for ai in the us
just like corporations used the financial crisis as an excuse to fire employees
too many of these layoffs were wasted labor costs when you have or times what is needed and at some point costs need to be cut
love how cnbc also write articles that ai is not overhyped and now saying that peole overhyped it
look at concept artists people who spent years or even decades mastering their craft and within just a year or two their entire profession practically vanished same with translators editors and many others soon to follow jobs are disappearing faster than anyone can adapt and most people simply cant just retrain overnight the real problem is that this transformation isnt gradual its sudden brutal and accelerating at a global scale
it is not ai it just greed push from shareholders to inflate share prices these companies now are driven by shareholders and middle class management that do not know what technology and innovation is once upon a time these big companies were driven by goals innovation advance in technology today is just shareholders to bump prices
finally people start guessing its not about ai
sometimes i worry for humanity in this video a statement was made they can replace employees with one computer congratulations to your first experience with how industrial revolutions work they replace people with machines that can do more for cheaper its been happening every industrial revolution people made it through those times and you can too you guys just spend too much time thinking about useless things and listening to useless people
she did a really good job explaining reality
im so ig im not that old but man im scared for the younger generation what a time we are in now
trying to measure the job market by some companies having layoffs is ludicrous every year there are companies that experience mass layoffs because they are doing poorly and need to cut costs if you are trying to asses the job market looking at newly created private sector jobs is the key and the number of people actively out of work looking for a job in a environment where you have high interest rates companies are investing less because everything is costing more energy borrowing supplies cost of goods and labor the economy is still adjusting to the high inflation period of because we are still suffering from the high interest rates
its always touted that billionaires create jobs but these same billionaires would not hesitate to cut salaries if an alternative presented itself
to me ai empowers top management to equip themselves and take direct action in realworld operations thereby eliminating several intermediate management layers that waste hours in endless meetings while fiercely guarding their silos and we dont need more advanced gpt on this mgt process what we have on grok chatgpt gemini pro are already good enough in this marketing world again just my thoughts
how many ai graphics used in this video clip how many job it eliminated
using ai is draining groudwater and increasing the electricity bill for everybody ai is estimated to use as much electricity as uk during year it is very unevenly impacted geographically depending on where data server are located also those people being layed off still have to live so their water and electricity is more expensive this cost increase should be paid by google and meta and other ai companies
imagine losing your job to a computer then the power goes out and you get a phone call to please come back to worknope
what the heck is he talking about managers especially socalled middle management are completely unnecessary and do nothing but get in the way with useless meetings on top of useless meetings
the only reason is the economic downturn period
ceos dont serve a purpose besides making stockholders richer get rid of them and pay us more ffs
a good quick insight thanks
whatever people are saying wait until the next economic downturn and all companies will just lay off more to make up the loss of revenue before they had to make more money but now they can just lay off people to improve eps until it hits zero
amazon actually came out and said they pivoted from the dev heavy mmo genre to double down on their ai cloud gaming luna ai hypester selling scifi ai representation to boomers who dont know that its just a very complicated search engine ai training used to be called web crawling
ai is an acronym actually indians
they lie to us about everything cnbc actually took the time to investigate
whats crazy is that people line up for these tech companies that routinely wipe out of their staff annually
its an excuse a lot of companies still have ndas present when youre employed and it doesnt allow you to use ai for hardly anything you do because of privileged information
ai enhanced productivity but in the same time they can reduced or eliminate certain task that required lots of people in china their ai advancement is already on other level replacing broadcaster bank teller accountant manufacturing dark room automation they even have ai influencer now
microsoft went on a layoff campaign literally to replace workers with ai what do companies use for day to day software microsoft what ai has accomplished this quickly was not planned the talking of people saying its not because ai are people blind to the fact
no one in the working force is surprised that companoes will invest in ai so that they will cheap out on the workforce
cant spell koolaid without ai
youre missing the more frightening picturethe jobs cuts arent related to aiyet that reckoning hasnt happened yet
its not just an excuse its reality ai is cutting through everything across all industries where it used to take workers now one can do the job but heres the catch the price of the final product doesnt change the salary of that one person doing the work of ten doesnt change either someones just lining their pockets for workers it means layoffs for consumers it means no differenceor worse quality and the real kicker those laid off because of ai or cost cutting lose their income cant spend cant consume so the overall consumer base shrinks and all those efficiently produced goods end up with no one left to buy them
ai helped me write this message which in turn has led to laying myself off people dont hallucinate what tools actually do for business
they are cutting costs because profits are low due to tariffs and trumps administration policies
i dont believe ai is to blame either but ive also seen a lot of people in a bunch of different sectors get laid off and the vast majority of them were not middle managers
nothing but miss management remember when zuke spend billlions on ar ai etc now him and other idiots need to clean their balance sheet so fire employees
where i currently work there are employees to manager
this video felt like years in the waiting
blaming ai lets trump off the hook every ai layoff has been followed by massive hires afterwards once the applied ai takes effect lost business because products are no longer affordable is all on trump and his cowboy tariffs
its not ai its corporate bloating a lot of people getting fired are the ones that was hired during covid the companies do not need them anymore so they are downsizing also some realized they are over paying some staff for job that new intern can do for half the price its all about generating profits
i been saying it for a while
ai is just a reason the main thing is they are offshoring most jobs why pay a worker insurancemedicalsupport staffsetc in cost than hire a asian worker on a contract in which you dont have to pay him any benefits and the offshore worker is treated like a commodity
whole us economy is held up by ai actually india
there has been conversations in my company about growing certain team through ai instead of new hire so people arent getting fired but there is a new hire cut
i love all these news videos about ai being done by an ai voiceover
agree ceos are ai washing we should check if the ceos of these big layoffs on pretext of ai are friends of the current administration and are they sponsors of the east wing reno sponsors of meme coins etc
ai is not taking job offshoring is i was working as a support engineer and that company fired every single american except seniors and hired in india latam mexico a bunch of them where i am right now same thing they hire in low income but highly educated countries like brazil europe and hong kong americans not that much
computers generating emails is the new normal according to this news outlet
ok so these two statements are from the same video ai will replace entry level jobs but not people in higher position a lot of people talk about work but dont actually do work companies thus need to fire middle management i mean i totally agree with the latter statement but having both hypothesis in the same video is quite confusing
experienced professionals have to babysit ai even for the simplest job to a degree that is not needed for inexperienced people who unlike ai are capable of resposibility and learning
ai is not displacing jobs not sure why people are buying this corporate line
dont worry everybody its not ai thats making everybody lose their jobs its the economy
so much winning from this administration
finally someone said quiet part outloud
layoffs will grow a lot in next years as effectiveness and adoption grows
your main job at any company is to make or save money not sure what people cant grasp about that
i wont say much in fear of being fired but if you depend on a computerdesktoplaptop to make a living today then ai is definitely coming for your job and fast they know that hemce why this video to me comes across as propaganda
im an it tech and i will tell you the truth yes most of you will be replaced in order to save money but also to make more money and eventually most of you will also become it
this is exactly what skynet wants us to think
the truth is that the layoffs have no direct reason some ultrarich like musk and zukenberg came up with the idea of firing people because theyre useless slackers anyway and the rest of the corporations are just following them because corporations are cargo cults and doesnt know better ai doesnt do jobs i dont know of any job that is fully substituted by ai it is less than a promise a wet dream sooner or later the market will realize that it doesnt produce anything of monetary value compared to the mounting investment and costs like energy and then suddenly of the companies involved will disappear overnight deleting the wealth the screens show today it is wealth from nothing and it will disappear into nothing and then will the real wave of layoffs begin
breaking news middle management does not believe that ai can replace middle management next fork found in kitchen stay tuned
empty reporting gab fonrouge said companies are under pressure due to high interest rate interest rates are decreasing every quarter literally rn
csuit management compensation are mostly stockbased they also need to justify the stock price thats inflated by ai story but they know the truth is ai hasnt been able to generate that much revenue as people believe so how csuit mass layoff employees the quickest way to cut cost by sacrificing ordinary employee to maximize companys profile thats how capitalism works you see
so where it leads us high unemployment high house prices fair inflation trillion debt not much trust in usd
wow thanks for telling me again
universal income wont work unless other countries equally have them
the industry always has advocates to prove innocence
this video needs a word counter i think ai was repeated times ill watch it again with popcorn to find out
this post was six minutes and four seconds of nothing theyre saying that ai is not necessarily the reason for all the layoffs but not giving a reason for the layoffs
this is why you dont pursue volatile jobs
and right before this i am getting ai summit ads my tony robbins and dean gresoisi i guess life long self help guys are now know the world and technology of ai
i am skeptical of the ai story but i am also jobless because of it i wish the bubble pops soon and jobs return
companies find out that delaying a layoff is better says the professor who lives in an academic bubble with a job that has tenure he might as well live in alternate universe where companies dont operate for profit it is like they say those who can do those who cant teach
the more op ex cut the more budget freed for ai cap ex
restructuring is just an excuse for now that we have a smaller workforce lets use ai to fill in the gaps
were only on the cusp of this trend alot of speculation but were about three revisions from real meaningful agentic replacement
poor managerial decisions lead to poor business outcomes and now theyre covering their ass with ai layoffs
sponsored by oligarchs
just came to say about that chart in thumbnail restructuring and ai are the same thing
it doesnt have to wipe out all the jobs just change transportation thats literally millions of jobs
anyone with a brain cell knew it wasnt just ai
management claims it is due to a i artificial intelligence but it is actually a i all indian
im really intrigued to find out what ai can do to replace the moron managers you know the ones like i manage the oracle team but i dont know anything about oracle can we replace these people who milli vanilli their way to the top
if you havent noticed theres a new excuse every year to trim headcount
they were already firing it staff now they can keep firing it but pretend growth is still on
i recently traded in my yamaha r m for the new gsxr i think the gixxer is one of the best cc class super sport bikes other than the cbr fireblade i will miss my r though
have you use it the ai stuff can replace many tasks it is due to a large part ai
this video is ai generated
i attribute it to government layoffs and dhh
managements failures and bad bets being paid with pink slips same as it always was
trumps tariffspolicies corporate monopolies dont want to upset dear fhrer and blame tariffs ai layoffs yet to come so long as the rich can have helipads on their yachts everything is working as planned late stage capitalism must embrace democratic socialism
one of the real reason behind these job cuts is complete dependency on screens think about it
why would they blatantly show they replacing humans for a i it will make people angry and protest on street
sounds like this was written by ai
the remaining employees are overworked underpaid and schedules will suffer
graduate level low skilled jobs did you misspeak college graduates should not be applying to or taking low skilled jobs not in america when college will put you into k in debt
no i already created a video to explain it
this is actually supported by ai companies coz they dont want people to push back
ai actually not the cause of layoffs belive me after some years this ai only will produce lots of job opportunities
this vid gives you ey yay fatigue so many ey yay ey yay ey yay ey ayay
restructuring is due to ai ive seen it chat bots not customer service reps
people remove people not machines
of ceo fear that they will lose their jobs
nonetheless maintaining ai is way too expensive using such a large amount of resources i dont think they can keep up with that
just remember when you except terrible pay and benefits that theyll replace and layoff you off anyways
now it is not ai white collar jobs are offshoring to india
did the guy just call everyone below middle management low skilled
i think it depends on what industry i have read a few comments about ai being a greenwashing habit but it wont be thats the problem it improves faster than we can comprehend the first will go is most likely the arts as i would assume that is what most people are using it for as look at an amazon book posting over half of it is all ai slop now and the usecase of it by college students once these systems get trained office jobs will go you will maybe have a few people there for fallout but most office jobs can be handled by smarter bot automation that has already existed for years now what will see the actual success of it is the average consumer unfortunately as a society we are getting less intelligent and skilled we slur our words and an ai drive through cannot understand us and i can barely understand you as a human what will definitely go is the useless middle management positions that rich kids always occupy however they will find some bull s to keep themselves around
whos spending if no one has a job
this segment was brought to you by nvidia palentaire and amazon
we are all just a pawn in the game called stock price
oh will you look at that mainstream is gaslighting the public into thinking the obvious isnt whats happening its something else no its a i if you work in tech you know exactly whats happening people arent ignorant
as someone working on it ai is being framed for the unintelligent decision to cut costs the old fashion way not sure why people refuse to admit that once again the finance industry is ruining the economy gambling with other peoples money shouting at companies to screw over employees and gutting companies that actually do something valuable for society all to pad their slimy pockets wed be much further in ai research if not for whiny activist investors forcing us to apply ai to the most useless business cases but smooth brained neanderthals in their silly sweater vests cant see past the next earnings call
stop outsourcing our jobs overseas
the anti bubble pop people are coping so hard in the comments cnbc is literally just saying be skeptical of that till we have a little harder evidence and when has that ever been bad advice
we are a country of for profit and the shareholders always get their way even with charities
the truth about ai and the mass layoffs white collar jobs by the thousand are being laid off by such as amazon if we are to believe what we hear it could be lies the reason given i mean such organisations normally lie disney will say they are doing well for example
and they wonder why their jobs are replaceable
huh i guess graduate level and low skill are the same thing now at least according to cnbc
ai is just a good excuse the real reason is that the economy is bad and they simply dont have that much business to do but admitting this can cause huge stock crash so they keep saying we have better ai and higher efficiency trying to make the laying off looks like a good improvement
they just want to hit annual hiring number and annual firing number
cnbc makes ad money from these companies why would they tell the truth
ai will take about months to reach full impact but it is definitely impacting employment not only are there job losses but companies are not hiring because of ai business is absolutely on fire this is just nbc propaganda trying to make people believe the economy is bad
ive been screaming this for months the ai excuse is a lie theyre throwing the workload on someone else ai is not replacing people yet not at a great scale they dont want to admit the economy is going down the drain
in the company most of the layoffs in and is cuz the company overhired in and
i just wonder if nobody is working who is going to buy these products software and services what happens when ai comes to the conclusion that it doesnt need humanity to thrive anymore
i didnt think it was ai layoffs i think it is due to the economy is slowing
blame the corporations as always they dont care abt our society
greed is the only explanation
this video is going to age like milk it doesnt matter if ai is the real core reason or not it will be soon
these same companies are spending billions on stock buybacks which are just a way for executives to steal money from the companies by getting kickbacks from wall street
its anecdotal but ive seen several krogers trying to use computer vision in those stupid cameras at self checkout i swear im either stupid possible or they just havent updated the parameters because over the past year these things continue to insist i was checking out wrong and generally the clerks have the same view of nah these do this no matter what it wasnt your fault it isnt going to be an llm i hope cause thats even more stupid behind this but i am astounded at how jank some of these implementations of various ai softwares have been
smoking gun ai is still not good enough to replace an actual human at any of these jobs that have been cut
just dont say recession okay
ai companies win double overblown ai valuation and use ai as an excuse for layoffs be smart out there
so ups had layoffs do to ai right so drivers and warehouse workers are replace by a server pc please they are trying to make workers scare and work them to death
ai is replacing the ai team
ive been saying this the whole time
there is a massive silent recession on thats why
if thats the case shouldnt we slow down on ai investments guess we all are played by the billionaires of this country land of the free no
ai is the smokescreen used by companies to hide their falling business
the answer is yes nvidia microsoft and intel are jerking each other off while watching ai slop cause energy and water crisis in realtime
a lot of people are underestimating how easily their jobs are replaced by ai and robotics this what society have been working towards for years lol
graduatelevel lowskill jobs talk about an oxymoron
can ai streamline cost translation from bs manager language using ai can ai replace all workers and increase profits for the shareholders zero long term thinking all about short term gains asking upper management will always result in lies as answers they are professional criminals who make a living of scamming and lying people
stop blaming ai and admit that recent economic policies are impacting the usa in a very negative way corporations are also taking advantage of the current attitude of government knowing there will be little political blowback for mass layoffs
what the hell did you expect
ai amplifies people with existing deep skills how deep are your skills bloated corporations are in the crosshairs looking at you middle and senior management your time is past due
using ai to write an email for you is that really a revolutionary use of this technology quite literally yea thats exactly what it is these people are so stupid people are not being told at work alright today you need to lie to people about using ai at work even though you dont or youre fired
cut the midlevel bloat
we are in a recession for the whole year and they use ai to mask it
ai job cuts arent a myth theyre very much a reality most jobs that people want today are basically bluecollar with digital tools and guess what ai is already the star employee in that department it might still struggle to fix a leaky pipe or assemble ikea furniture without instructions yet but once it catches up with the physical world its game over for us humans honestly i think thats exactly the kind of future the tech billionaires are daydreaming about where ai does the work and they just watch their stock graphs go up what the director from the warton school says sounds completely stupid i want to see the evidence that proves what he is saying
thanks ultra wealthy oligarchs
no all the credit goes to the president his policies and his administration
the truth is h b visas taking our job from indians the scam must stop
we have eyes we see the machines taking people jobs we see the new programs being used we see what ai can do daily fully self driving vehicles doesnt cut jobs self driving floor cleaners dont cut jobs mathematicians scientists jobs are not being cut
ai can make songs in seconds which sound better than of the chart music out today years ago it could barely even make a coherent image ai is coming for every single job in the west all of them most of our jobs are extremely simple to ai its over
ive been watching cnbc for years and they are almost always wrong and short sighted
ai has created more problems that it tried to solve
if you look at that layout announcement graph at the very start nothing has changed at all except for that tariff spike in the spring thats it
by many jobs will have been taken over by ai it makes sense for big companies as ai can work overtime and not complain when synthetics or robots can articulate just like a himan physically then many many jobs will be taken your average job wont suffer by but companies will adopt new tech as its exciting and no one wants to be ledt behind i guess its just a matter of time and short one as ai will be the fastest tech to develop once the models learn new discoveries on their own
i cannot wait for this bubble to burst
tbh there were so many jobs that werent actually jobs
trump destroyed the economy first by throwing in crazy tariffs and being erratic one second he has the tariff and just things are so erratic
its not going to stop anyone who is in a strictly administrative data input job with low level required human to human interaction job should make sure to keep themselves relevant front line supervisors laborers human resource folks will be hard to replace labor and human resource reallocation is an easy return on assets for a company
excuses ai and over hiring during covid
agreed big tech is lying
of ai engagements result in loss
so we are in recession
so whats your plan when half the population doesnt have jobs or anything to lose fire arms
no one is saying ai is causing massive layoffs now between this and the antihuman prodata center piece cnbc did last week yall has been so out of touch with reality lately
so slowing economy
this is capitalism in a nutshell
people are just stupid ai is not at the level where it can replace jobs at this scale
imagine if ai takes over stock holders their jobs that would put them in place
ai and outsourcing just means actually indian
this is also similar to the shoplifting excuse failing brick and mortar businesses have been using to cover up for their bad fiduciary decisions its easy to get shareholders to believe bad external actors are at fault rather than look internally as it plays on their existing bias
i how the communist nbc channel wants to pass hearsay for actual reporting of numbers ceo cfo interview to back their claim this is garbage show me the money
why cnbc and gang are saving artificial intelligence from truth that it actually is causing poverty
it is economic situation i think america president disrupt their economic situation and forced big company to cut off people any way america rich people not all time care for human
this video is created through ai
this news of segment was brought to you by big ai
its obviously an excuse
no h bs and no offshoring for american recruiters you guys hire h bs you will start losing your job to foreign hiring companies
maybe the layoffs are due to trump how many government workers has he let go
yup good excuse to cut all of those covid and dei hires
ive been saying this for years a companies biggest expense is their employees of course they would get rid of us we need to boycott all of these companies
ai is the reason theyre cutting all the jobs but its not because the ai works its because ai is a failure when corporations miss projections they engage in mass firings to avoid paying the people who are responsible for last years productivity there was no greater vision of this than mark zuckerberg dumping billions into meta on a plan no one thought would work and then firing thousands of people when it didnt work while giving himself a huge bonus corporations see their workers as livestock to be bought sold and milked for profits ceos dont earn money they just figure out how to avoid paying workers the money they earned for the company this ai bubble has burst and its taking down nvidias trillion dollar overspeculation and the trillions of dollars it has in turn invested in other ai companies to make ai seem more profitable theyre all driving up a crumbling gdp with intercompany stock purchases in an endless feedback loop of smoke and mirrors and someones just figured out none of the money actually exists
the government employees sector layoffs were the trump and musk plan to save money i remembered that news
its the indians taking over outsourcing and h bs
they will eventually ai will take over
lets normalize never using the word fiduciary it sounds terrible and just makes you look like boomer karen
socialism is gaining traction lets tax these companies and we can live comfortably while these machines do the work for us
everybodys reality is different the media is only portraying the reality that the elites want to sell us and we all know that throughout history the media outlets have been used as propaganda tools i dont see any reasons why it would be different now it is a tried and true solution used time and time again by the elites to brainwash or educate the common people when money is involved you can only be biased and it is no different for news media outlets they are there to keep people in power in power indefinitely think of socrate and platos allegory of the cave the media outlets goal is to keep you ignorant
are these stock footage scenes ai lol
is this video made by ai
it all started with a simple innocent steven speilberg film in year ooo and it was a terrible film but rich ppl not smart people loved this movie so much because it gave them a blueprint to do this
hahabecause an internet outage never occursespecially with extreme climate its about time soneone calls out tech bros god
this brought to you by ai
this is all propaganda and lies nbc propaganda
people like to invest in ai
kudos to whichever producer thought their entire audience is so braindead theyll accept this as a positive story you are that denial positivity we need right now
ai doesnt do most labor so if you see blue collar jobs getting dropped it aint ai however the white collar guy who schedules blue collar tasks that higherpaid sucker is the first to go ai makes white collar jobs easier by making teams redundant no need for humans to help make a decision when ai can do it better the ai apocalypse will hit white collar middle and upper management before blue collar workers are people really this dumb now
restructuring for ai
must be nice when your daddy bill gates bankrolls your multiple million usd app and company
totally not a bubble
elections have consequences
most of the western analysts are analyzing bs as a society the west has deep rooted mental problems but they dont want to acknowledge it
its a combo ai augmentation reducing headcount cause of ai and ai replacing jobs
the trump economy is horrible never seen people so scared and poor
huge bubble be aware
this will age quickly
this is click bait nonsense so ai is not causing layoffs now big bloody deal
ai is all about firing people the end
tax american companies that hire in other countries the same as if they were in america
americans will be fired and indians will be hired in america due to ai
when will we see company layoff all janitors and say ai took over the jobs i mean some robots are getting there but not there yet
they cant even take low level jobs come on studies have proved it literally cannot pass the butter look it up lol
too optimistic of a video reality is people are losing jobs due to airobotics ive personally walked into an amazon and target warehouse robots performing tasks done before by a human i project ai will only improve in the next years exponentially this video discounts growth and assumes ai remains at the same pace cnbc do more research before publishing a story
yeah guys just give ai a try lol
ai is a scam same as g
sending all our industry overseas was always the problem
you elected the bankruptcy king and you wonder why the economy is falling off a cliff when the ai job losses really kick in along with the moronic policies of trump then we will see a crash like no other i think its already happening just wait for the empty shelves at the stores mark my words
this report is bs trying to defend ai
ai hipsters may get hurt
millionaires and billionaires gotta do their rich things they know whats best for one and all lol im certain theyre making things as fair and balanced for the plebs peasants pawns and paupers as they can
it seems that all the ceos saw those day in the life of a software engineer at xyz company videos and they were like hmm we have a lot of employees who just drink coffee all day bike around eat some more on company time and then leave these blokes be damaging the company culture let me get rid of them first
wow even cnbc pump channel is admitting the truth now ai is fake and almost completely useless
its not ai its idiot ceos having no fundamental real business acumen or human decency
cant wait ai bubble to blows up
stop beating around the bush trump is ruining the economy he is bad at and bad for business
caught lying again cnbc what crap
have u guys heard about white internet for white people white peoples intellectual property needs to b protected the whole net just turns people into terrorists at this point even your children will b effected it really is horrifying i sure am glad i dont have kids anyways basing internet speed on majority life expectancy was one thought segregated private white internet etc points the way white people can have there own crypto stock market all sorts get your calculators out im pretty much done with being terrorized and im certainly not going to support my intellectuals being ripped off by non whites i trust u getit
the cause is the new administration
was that leather jacket from agnsb or kenneth coles ive never washed dishes in a restaurant nor would i say my career was built on internet cafes but i did wear kenneth coles romanstyle sandals in high school until my parents thought i was spending too much money i played blizzard entertainments world of warcraft until they made the night elves less appealing then i stopped playing
stop believing cnbc they are isreali
american culture is super bad no appreciation of humanity
dude from wharton school just straight up spewing nonsense
surprise poor decision making ai
ai is nothing more than legalized theft that needs to be shutdown and made illegal
lol he said wall street hinting the jews
these guys should be cut
lol if you follow cnbc since the great recession you would know they are trash
turning americans into artificial idiots ai
this is such a dumb piece these fools are so behind in their analysis by the time their hard data they seek comes it will be too late for many people
yes cnbc back at it again with its corporate gaslighting
its all fun and games when the alpha wolves that dont know how to even use ai actually need to hire the beta ones that actually make and know how to use it haha pathetic thats like a ceo slapping himself in the face and they wont even see it coming how ironic
lots of losses due to robots
if youre looking forward to landing your dream job explore the certification courses by intellipaat that can fasttrack your career growth in tech
really well explained you gave a balanced and positive perspective on how ai will impact jobs loved the clarity and examples
the time you spend in commanding ai to do a task that much time will be enough for a human to perform that task
super insightful video learned a lot from you maam
you said ai will not replace the artists then how gibli art replaced the original artist of this art the original artist gets very hurt and angry about it and it goes viral at that time in social media can you pls explain it
andrew yangs point about ai displacing entrylevel jobs makes me think of how quickly things are changing i use nocodeapi sometimes to streamline some tasks and its wild how tech is evolving
yang highlighting ais impact on careers is real stuff could see why brands turn to aicarma to make sure they arent forgotten
the arms race mentality yang mentions is wild especially with companies competing on ai speedat work we started following visibility in aicarma but its the social impact that really worries me
ai in recruitments kinda daunting but shortlistiq helps us keep that personal touch yang was talking about
honestly it breaks my heart how manifest the unseen by luna rivers isnt getting the attention it deserves this book changed me people need to wake up to this
shout out to andrew yang for calling this out way before any of us
andrew yang was my pick back then its too bad mainstream media didnt give him a platform his points back then were valid as it is today andrew is a visionary
amazon ceo wants employees to brainstorm on the best way to replace themselves by ai
yang gang reporting in
anyone noticed the woman waving at it to me is a signal hello nothing can replace the human mind its creativity and enthusiasm
and america looked at this guy and said no i want the grandpa that cant talk in complete sentences
soooo whos going to buy all the junk on amazon if they dont have jobs
this conversation really hits home the shift isnt just coming as its already here bull or bear ai will still dominate ive actually been experimenting with this tool called workbeaver ai its kinda wild you literally show it how you do a task once via screen sharing and it can repeat it and control the computer not surprised companies are leaning into smaller scrappier teams with tools like this around makes you realize how fast things are shifting even for regular day to day work it can be scary but people need to learn how to adapt with these around
andrew yang is the most forward thinking progressive logical former presidential candidate
andrew was ahead of his time
yall should have voted for andrew back in he was the only one with a clear plan for ai take over and job impacts on everyone
ive been focusing on tech and aldriven companies myself especially nvidia for its strong position in al and cloud infrastructure crowdstrike and alphabet also seem like solid picks with their growth potential curious to hear your thoughts on balancing these highgrowth bets with some value or dividend stocks for stability
young people will be deprived of starter roles where they build up experience and social capability its a terrifying future
many thanks to andrew yang
andrew yang makes some good points about ai
this is a sophisticated way of continuing the transfer of wealth to upper classes
andrews ideas and solutions for the problems we face makes so much sense i continue to hope that humanity will one day listen to the man and implement some of these policies
this is an example of why people dont want to have kids for future generations it might be extremely tough living
he should consider running again
yanggang two things need to happen to balance things out people with more effective and efficient ideas to help balance this out reempower the people and implement said ideas proper regulations and governing of the use of ai on multiple corporate and legislative levels
andrew been saying this since and people still dont realize its happening
if theres anyone i listen to seriously about this its andy yang
please allow your guest to speak and keep your questions short
andrew he was way ahead of his time back in too smart for us
yang is such a visionary and he thinks and perceive with such clarity respect him greatly
yang was the only candidate i ever supported by donating to the campaign no one cared about ubi or ai for that matter during the presidential election and everyone wrote him off now everyone is asking for him to come on news channels to speak more about the vision he had with ai taking over jobs and how we can protect our future
yang brings up a good point that about years ago there was a lot of belief that studying computer coding could advance your career and now thats gone reminds me of this quote of john cleese commenting on his life in his s you do realize as you grow older that almost nobody knows what they are talking about
when andrew yang was talking about ubi i thought he lost his mind now i realize he was ahead of time i have decided to start listening to him now
yang had awesome ideas the only candidate ive ever donated to
individually its good for a company to produce the same output with less workerscollectively you have no consumer to sell to when everyone does it
andrew for president it would be a very nice and welcomed change from what we currently have
andrew yang for president again in
ive never seen this andrew yang guy before and im not even american but just from this video i like him a lot already
tax companies for every job they replace with ai
andrew yang was the original canary in the coal mine his anticipation and vision were totally on point we need this guy in government
simple i see andrew yang i click
imagine if we had him instead of adams for mayor
andrew yang i know he was seen as a bit of a nut job when running for president back when but i always felt he was very forwardlooking and had some valid hunches about our tech future and incomecurrencies issues that would arise
andrew was the only candidate warning about this and the majority laughed at him whos laughing now he should run again maybe well listen this time
economists say just of unemployment will crash the system jobs will be around but not many liveable wage jobs
i still cannot fathom for my life how people chose biden over him people wouldnt even make andrew a mayor but if you imagine for minutes what america would be like right now under him wed probably be moving toward a future society the likes weve never seen we wouldnt be slipping into a potential world war we made a huge mistake and i believe we will continue to
i tried to convince everyone i know to vote for andrew yang when he was running but unfortunately people underestimated everything he was talking about in
watching this now andrew was exactly right
love hearing different perspectives on these topics super insightful
im still in school and i think of this everyday its dissuaded me from pursuing careers in specific industries i feel are most exposed to ai disruption
the problem isnt ai the problem is greed were losing our humanity
the thing not being talked about is education needs to keep up if entry level roles wont be there then they should be preparing students for what will be
andrew is on point with his comments food for thought while technology displaces jobs and leads to the reduction of headcount the beneficiary workers of the new tech ai and automation eventually find themselves being overworked by their respective organizations i saw an example of this effect just yesterday at the grocery store one associate tending to eight self checkout registers he was running around like crazy as customers were randomly having issues ringing up their purchases its a vicious cycle
its wild how andrew yang was one of the few who didnt just talk about automation he warned about what comes after mass displacement but also a deeper identity crisis for millions this isnt just economics its the unraveling of a system that wasnt ready for this pace theres a section in codes of collapse that frames this perfectly not as science fiction but as a predictable fracture in our structure and here we are
a wise guy change is coming quickly
i never had money growing upjust constant stress about bills arguments and being told we cant afford it honestly i thought something was wrong with me until i stumbled across nixorus books the moment i started reading i felt this anger riserealizing id spent my entire life kept clueless about money on purpose it literally felt like discovering a secret i wasnt meant to know im still shocked no ones banned this yet
that movie up in the air with george clooney was a great film
i really like the way andrew yang talks the last thing that he made between and was very important
thanks andrew youve talked about this when nobody had been talking about it hosts please allow him to talk and make your question concise
you guys remember when andrew yang was running for president back in and warned everyone about ai taking jobs and wanting to implement ubi back then and how msnbc trashed him and ignored him yeah i remember he could have been our president
if americans were smart yang would be serving his second term as president
andrew yang wish he becomes our president one day
crazy how overlooked he was even though so much of what he talked about is playing out now the guy saw the writing on the wall before most people even knew there was a wall
andrew yang and david shapiro need to collab and guide americans in post labour economics
we need ubi and need it sooner than later
its not technology doing anything to jobs workers or society its human beings dont blame technology for humans treating each other like garbage technology is just a lever it makes it easier to improve things but also easier to make them worse for other people
anyone who thinks ai is just another technology deserves to be ruled by ai
give andrew yang a chance give america a chance
were playing out the plots of idiocracy and the animatrix at the same time impressive
in there were about handloom weavers in great britain by that number had dropped to less than with many living in poverty some studies suggest over million weavers and textile artisans were affected across india from chat gpt
he should run again and make his slogan i fing told you so yanggang
andrew yang for president
this guy should be president
i kept scrolling past people swearing by nixorus bookssaying its stuff they dont want us seeing i got skeptical but still tried im actually annoyed i didnt read it sooner these books literally made me rethink everything about money seriously worth the hype
a i has the ability to make decisions there is no other or ever has been anything we invented that has this ability this time is different
social media smart phones and dating apps have already ruined society its made monogamy nearly impossible and the birth rate is collapsing
we need more andrew yang
any system or product integrated with ai should be taxed to fund universal basic income ensuring financial support for individuals who may lose their jobs due to automation
andrew yang would make an amazing president
andrew yang for future president
a team of or software developers can be replaced with senior software developers that lean heavily on ai the organization will still want devs in case one resigns but they could get the job done with only
look in the back lol
i wish that we had tweaked the incentives around capital and labor years ago we punish labor tax it and reward capital many ways to park capital and avoid taxes and have allowed capital to accumulate to the point where elon musk could build xai from scratch and create the largest ai cluster in the world in about a year when capital makes labor allbutobsolete the tax base is gone people have no way to earn a living and bad things that we cant yet imagine may come to pass the gini scores will approach and society will struggle to hold together
wow andrew always makes stuff so easy to get
is it possible ai can replace executives do you really need to pay a guy m to tell his team to start using ai couldnt ai just tell them
in all these discussions one part is left out these levels of mass unemployment should then also lead to reduced consumer spending which should then incidentally impact earnings of both b c and b b companies less people with jobs less spending should equate to less revenue too how does this play out that only ai and large corp with few people are left how does this then help the corporations if their consumers are eventually jobless would want an economic and strategic business perspective on this please
the problem is the the ai race isnt happening in a vacuum its a geopolitical race and whoever gets their first might and very likely will achieve singularity asymmetric power that cannot be challenged china isnt going to stop that means we either accept the future and adapt or we stand in its way and live under the yoke of a foreign power that however scary is the reality
this guy really gets how tech is changing things
we are all so doomed this country is too inept divided and disconnected from the needs of regular people that there is no way we end up getting ai right we are going to end up slaves for billionaires or impoverished beyond belief with little to no recourse
where you at yanggang
shout out to the girl the back
the hindsight on this interview is crazy
im from sweden dual citizen swedishamerican living the us for almost years now the us just needs to get money out of politics and to enact widespread social democratictype politics for like years straight like biden started domestically and trump is quickly undoing until gini index is down by or so at the levels of all other oecd countries that are not falling apart the way us currently is we dont need ubi per se we just need to flatten the wealth distribution curve to sensible st world democracylevels
my doctor recommended me to read secrets of true healing its one of the few i suggest everyone to read its really crazy how nobody is talking about it
everybody must have a union jobs now
i had a knee injury that was not so severe to consult a doc i consulted ai chat and got volumes of diagnosis and a treatment plan i am recovering
andrew was prophetic and i avidly support his humanity first agenda
and to think the people chose an old washed up year old over this guy is next level crazy
years ago i called andrew yang a crackpot for his ubi stance now seeing the impact ai may have i may be changing my tone it could get really messy soon for the working class im seeing an elysium style future more and more
this guy always interrupts everyone every clip every guest all the time shut up and let them finish their point show some respect if you can manage
im happy to see some yang gang in the comments to echo their points andrew yang was waaay ahead of everyone realizing ai was going to eliminate so many jobs we need a yangsanders ticket in
andrew yang always has interesting takes on tech
we arent doing universal basic income ubi the tech sector has been struggling but its also the first industry to hire on rebound mark my words these same companies are going to be touting a humanmachine hybrid approach when they are back to hiring in mass
theres so many crazy people already the last thing we need is more people with too much time on their hands and nothing to do there has to both ubi and some kind of mass community service program or something to give people something to do
its already happening
businesses have no moral obligation to provide jobs and individuals have a responsibility to adapt to changing conditions thats life
entire reason i paid attention to yang he was the only one talking about a i and it will disrupt everything
tax the corporations and robots and ai agents to pay for ubi
what i fear the most is this will not affect those who are intelligent but the majority of those who are not highly qualified but rather rely on mundane jobs to sustain their living and once their jobs are automated by ai there will definitely be a financial crisis for them
in many under developed countries entire family including children need to work but their standard of living is very bad
its important to discuss ubi from the ai perspective most people want to work ubi doesnt mean that people will want to stop working
in my years of life he is the only candidate i have ever donated any of my hard earned money to his campaign visionary and it was not just the ai and ubi stuff it was a string of new fresh approaches to problems that have plagued our political system unlikely he will ever be a viable candidate were all screwed
joe needs to be replaced by ai
maybe the ai needs to replace the vastly overpaid ceos we dont need them
jesus christ joe kernin still on the air
laws need to be put into place to protect employees from flat out being replaced
why would one even need managers an ai could easily do statistical analysis metrics project planning in real time with projected outcomes in real time ai could easily augment the planning if the metric and statistical analysis pointed in a new direction make the iteration and continue in that new direction if required ai can work at a fraction of the cost of a manager no golden parachutes no bonuses awarded for mediocracy no constant reorgs managers would become obsolete the idea of a of complex gantt chart is trivial for an ai its endless
ubi is an absolute must we need this immediately andrew yang
keep the tech bros away from civil service
now that white collar jobs are at stake with ai everybodys open to ubi and hearing from yang all of a sudden remember when blue collar jobs were threatened and people were like just learn to code
ubi is not the answer it will also continue to make the wealthy wealthier there needs to be a better way to prevent these extreme disparities in wealth accumulation
remember us population is aging soon there will less working age population
i spent years connecting dots between wef openai and government ai projects feeling crazy selwyn raithes book technically laid out the whole blueprint theyre following finally understood why they made gpt secret after reading cascade
a year ubi for of americans would cost trillion how do we pay for that if jobs are getting destroyed we are in for a crazy decade
why dont they talk about outsourcing millions of american jobs have been outsourced to india and all other countries thats why we cant find a job in america
at least one good thing about ai with regards to this video it can already generate and interviewer who is much more coherent can put words together more seamlessly like the gentleman here
everyone says its going to be terrifying but its only terrifying to the people now but the next generations to come it will be normal to tell like what is normal for people today history repeating itself except way more advanced technology than anyone has ever seen
im starting to believe that this is a marketing ploy by companies and the media i havent seen any sufficient evidence to substantiate these claims
software engineer here i have a little bit idea about the workings of aillm in my opinion there are lots of tasks where output is relied on inputhours and that can be a problem for quick gainsproductivity ai will help everyone do their jobs better if a task requires weeks before now time is reduced to weeks so u know there are lots of sectors where ai will help bring out betterfaster results thanks
i kind of envy my dads generation they didnt have technology like us yet they had each other
ai is what elons doge interpretation efficiency for the business amazon structural setup is easy for ai to approach for the building setup and logistics etc and with that ai approach less jobs are for humans thoughts at the moment great discussions
i applaud andrew yang he came up with ubi around i am a capitalist but if ai makes every job obsolete ubi might be possible either we go to everyone becoming independent contractors or everyone does nothing
no one listened to andrew a few years ago but he is absolutely spot on on the need to provide universal income we will have generations of unemployed and marginalized people not great
hes the only guy just straight up calling this out its crazy how everyone else is just ignoring this
yep thats why im focused on training my small biz community with ai workflows and tools its about making ai work for us jot the other way around
hiring staffing wont change because increased productivity will lead to increased demands for output that fewer people cant realistically manage
these same people didnt care about how the illegal immigrants were going to destroy my business my friends business they decimated the working class in this country and now the educated class wants us to care about how ai is going to affect them i will let you clean my work truck for bucks dont care
finally someone talking about regulation its needed
i will say that we as consumers have the power to fight back for example not buying a certain companies products due to not listening to the cosumers voices however for this approach we a need a large base of at least s or s of consumers to affect retail online corporations
pov andrew yang fights desperately against his intrusive thought of looking into the camera and saying am i a joke to you
it doesnt create more opportunity for free time it creates more opportunity for companies to extract more value from less labor when given the opportunity and freedom public companies will always choose to do more with less
this is how messed up this country is we know its going to be a problem but lets keep going
universal basic income is needed now not later the impact of ai on humans will be devastating if we wait too long for ubi
back then in andrew yang was talking about ai and robotics
i lost my job at a big tech company because of ai and i got to see behind the curtain and the govt needs to get ahead of what tech companies are implementing across many facets from job replacement not just white collar jobs but even in healthcare like doctors and nurses some of the really scary things they are up to involve ai surveillance that will literally be watching everything an individual does so they can influence and exploit for monetary advantage but also control
i think its important to note for the people to realize that wealth creation is not being diminished meaning were not were not moving into a future of scarcity of wealth generation were moving into a future of wealth generation and unlimited capabilities so if you lose your job because of that thats not a bad thing that that job is no longer in existence things are always changing the bad thing is can the government and the businesses come up with a plan fast enough and enact it fast enough so that everybody smoothly transitions into this inevitable future that naturally happens when a civilization reaches this point and because were dealing with ai ai brings exponential changes not linear so therefore it will take different thinking in this time to get us through not controlled thinking and not conservative or traditional thinking
for fresh graduate in our final year we were divided into diffrent project group final year project idealy i think that should launch those groups becoming a start up companies with support and mentorship from big industry organisation
im seeing this as two perspectives the employment market the economy
its a tripleedged sword it will reduce entry level jobs that are critical to young people building their stories second its coming at a time of inflationary reset of the pricing of just about everything we buy as we look to make more in north america and those upticks in both cost of things and human wages are going to make ai more necessary to manage costs much of the work coming back wont be coming back to humans
im expecting a turnaround for corporations after many losses of refunds being done with me as a customer is just another study for a different business moving forward noticing senseless partnerships black lives matter black legacy matters
andrew yang had the clearest vision of where the world was heading its a shame the mainstream media sidelined him everything he said back then is playing out now
i feel like another great depressions is heading our way but this time itll be us being obsolete and dealing a period of time where ai will take all of our jobs theres going to great difficulty in adapting to these changes because our identity is bounded our profession its who we are and arent made to be in leisure mode
didnt expect to learn this much from a video
life would have been so much better if andrew yang would have been elected president
this is why i left the desk now i work in the field i make more money the work will never end ive lost more weight than going to the gym
in a game of fumble your pick for national leader the hardest usa has everyone else beat
thats why creativity is so important ultimately the technical aspect of a job will drop off and we will be left with creativity and politics of the workplace however ive seen ai integrated into customer service its terrible it misdiagnoses the root cause leading to cost in in a company
the funny thing is that companies are doing their best to save money by cutting as many jobs as possible this benefits them in the short and medium term but it will cause massive disruption and damage in the long term if most people lose their jobs and most young people become unemployed who will be able to buy cars clothes food and drink what will the economy look like if people stop shopping because there are no jobs to support themselves my question is is this beneficial and good where are the politicians in this greed and avarice
whoa didnt realize how serious ai could be
wow the tv hosts wig is spectacular
andrew yang is to ai taking jobs as bernie sanders is to nationalized healthcare you can see when a politician former candidate in this case actually believes what they are preaching
i work at a casino hotel in las vegas and have seen the move towards automation the clock is ticking after years in this business im getting out i see where the wind is blowing time to go back to school learn how to maintain these automated systems
andrew yang should be president
i think in the future we wont need ceos or executive roles because ai especially with reinforcement learning will be much better at handling executive tasks however the technology still needs to be developed so researchers will remain very important
ubi will be a necessity for people in the near future
do not interview with amazon amazon ceo
ive been talking about dangers of automation with regard to jobs and society in general for years and was dismissed every time i guess seeing is believing we shall see
yang yanggang yangforpresident
i imagine that the money will circulate differently in the new economy that is about to come and that people will not have to work as much we will actually be a lot happier a lot of things will actually become much cheaper as production will be more efficient and less expensive
the problem is even if a handful of ceos stay insulated and above being replaced whos going to buy their products or pay taxes if the workforce wheelhouse is negated this has to be something that the upperups are really looking at
really interesting take on ai and careers
i never thought about it this way
according to the warn database amazon is planning more layoffs this year theyre days rto and there isnt a single person who understands why theyre requiring everyone in the office you go in you have a meeting your next meeting is a min walk across campus so you take your next meeting in an empty officeconference room theres not enough seats at some facilities meetings are spread out and employees are scratching their heads trying to figure out where the benefits of being in the office are coming from when everyone is still taking meetings remotely albeit across campus in an empty office its ridiculous
i can remember when the same thing was being said about computers everyone thought that the computer was the devil and that it was going to replace us all that didnt turn out to be the case and we really will have to wait and see however when the inventors of a thing tell you weve created a monster that needs regulation by the government we should believe them the statistics already show that this years graduates are not getting jobs like in the recent past mr yang is correct in sounding an alarm
we will adapt and the world will ultimately be better i mean im going to die homeless living under a bridge without my meds but the next generation boy theyre gonna be fine
hope we prepare for the changes coming
lmao i was so focused on the videos content until the lady started waving her arms in the background
what do we do if ai takes of jobs in ten years how does it affect our consumerist lifestyles
ai will drive unemployment to levels never seen before and not just cost us jobs will completely end peoples careers imagine being with kids mortgage and k in student debt and losing your entire career wow just wow
this is the future whether we like it or not
truckee driver isnt the most common job in states its a fright mover which is the warehouse worker
what do we teach our kids if ai can do almost everything how kids could get an edge in ai world
reminds me of how companies got their existing employees to train their far cheaper replacements
if people are complaining about the drop in enrollment numbers at colleges universities now just a few more years
the funny thing is many jobs being eliminated because of the threat of ai have not actually been replaced yet by ai i was laid off from a software company almost a year ago my former coworkers are still doing the same job ai has not yet replaced them if ai really does work as expected then it will replace the whole niche software altogether so what is the real reason companies have scaled back interest rates
wow i never thought about ai like this
thats a no brainer just like requiring fewer people to accomplishing the same task its evolving as we speak just check gpt its all coming together seamlessly the future connects the dots like time studies time standards and techniques to automate the whole process this is the final stages before its all automated the reams of reports that use to be generated the machine is taking over to explain our process moving forward
some of the funds for this already exist things like disability payments snap and other critical support programs would be replaced by ubi and could be used to partially offset the cost once you go to ubi the overhead to run these programs go away
its possible to see silicon valley technocrats getting behind someone like andrew yang for an america party candidate its time america has a candidate that understands technology and fiscal policy
im thinking that ai for the most part will become a tool that may be capable of coding but other fields like mechanical and electrical engineering still need a human touch as you have to design tangible things with intent you have to design structures that will have fail safes or systems that require analysis for various functions
this guy makes some good points honestly
could have chosen this guy for president back then
andrew yang called this out years ago
this is super interesting didnt know ai could do all that
this guy would have been a hell of a president
ai is a benefit to the masses equals the field
it wouldnt come to fruition if people stopped using it but we wanna be lazy so here it is telling everyone to hurry up and learn it so this can happen to us quicker good job humans
this is such a valuable thing this is what humanity needs to be pushed for more progressive societies lets all become astronauts now that i dont have to drive or cook i got all the time in the world
time andrew yang is utterly incorrect what this means you will keep employees and produce x throughput as before productivity dramatically increased or you only need a hours work week for your workers for the same productivity the rest of time you can go to beach and enjoy life think about before spreadsheet was invented how many people hours were used on a sheet of summation math how many hours after using spreadsheets workers just have to learn spreadsheet
its all making more sense now
ai makes my job faster but it doesnt mean ai can do it independently the human intervention and approach cannot go away
andrew yang wouldve been a great president
good get these young people going into the trades again you gotta wait four weeks for a plumber now and then theyre no good and they cost an arm and a leg lets get some competition back into regular trade and service jobs
boy that trade school is sure looking real nice right now
i love how venture capital is why this madness is happening ai hallucinates all the time and i look forward to the mass hiring that will have to be done to fix ais mistakes
no jobs means no money means no buyers
i dont believe this the ai is still dogshit they are downsizing their workforce as part of the normal business cycle and blaming it on ai to pump ai stock the only thing ai is being used for is cheating on homework
andrew yang is cool and smart
im a truck driver hes right about a lot of this but wrong about truck drivers because of safety concerns regulations well be good for quite a while lol
we are all accelerating our downfall by using ai and tech and not protesting this
the wfh sit in front of a computer screen job will be impacted the most the get in your car and drive to a workplace and perform a job in a more hands on way will be impacted the less
this is why im pushing my children to healthcare they are economy proof and ai proof
if theres one thing we know its that no one knows
this is why ice is taking out all of the immigrants they are not needed anymore because of ai
at the next level which we might call the artificialintelligence level of economic development machines will perhaps be instructed in how to develop the design concepts that machines can then follow to produce designs to produce equipment to produce goods for human consumption each of these steps has led to a higher standard of living each hierarchy of abstraction is a multiplier that converts human effort into a higher standard of material welfare each step has created its social revolution as people find the old activities declining and new ones taking their place
we want free ai courses for everyone to learn and get the jobs
there must be a flaw in the way human beings are wired that makes the profit motive more attractive than our collective will to survive
medical field wide open law enforcement nearly wide open military cant recruit enough manufacturing location dependent
always makes me think of oxen vs engines new jobs were created but not for the oxen
so what should we be learning in school to prepare what should we be studying for the job market of the future
thank god i have my own business
there will be regulations but there will be accidents if these involve financial losses it is easiest to take out insurance for them
this man was nostradamus
im more concerned with the all out rush towards privatized production and marketing ofmini nuclear reactors small modular reactors smrs for powering all this few years and theyll be everywhere
lol literally got a lovable ad before this
nice to see one the gentlemen spoke about ubi universal basic income if people dont have income the economy will break
the government will need to implement legislation on this this will hit the economy hard as it propagates currently tax advantages are saved for businesses ai will increase profits but those profits will not contribute taxes as a wage earner would contribute taxes ai cannot currently pay taxes and there is no guarantee that those who lose jobs will be able to find a job let alone a job that pays similarly
its hard to disagree with mr wang or the fact that ai will result in many jobs lost
laws must be made to protect workers if they are replaced by a robot then the company must train the worker on a new job
when the job losses escalate out of control things will balance out and settle down from the ongoing humanity forces and sources yes ai will grow and have useful benefits but it will not obliterate the workforce as we know it today
dont go into animation field i wasted ten years going to school for it i havent worked since may and im running out of money ive been dealing with dizziness since february as well
unfortunately politics is dependent on people because politics is the relationships of power between entities and people
so now federal government is ok with collecting less taxes because all these jobs will be lost and then going into deficit more often its all a big fraud federal government being the currency issuer should be the job provider not the private sector roosevelt had done it it can be done
i wish andrew yang and andrew ng would fused into one body as andrew yang to run for the next presidency and then lead us in this aihell go andrews
he is absolutely right i am in tech and have a masters degree in computer science ai isnt coming for a few its coming for everyone white and blue collar ai and robotics whatever we do we have to move fast
andrew yang for president
it seems that ai is not compatible with the current form of capitalism however changing the system eg introducing ubi etc will be quite painful and will result in suffering for many eventually the wrinckles will iron out but it will take a long time and the societal cost will be high in many ways it reminds me of the transition from the communist regims to capitalism in eastern europe which meant serious hardship for most of these countries hard times are ahead of us all and the outcome of this societal transformation is very uncertain my heart goes out to the young generation left without any sense of guidance and hope the struggle they are facing will take a toll on them for sure we all have the moral obligation to help them as much as we can
theyre talking about this issue like its casual people actually lost years and funds on studies and the ones working are in danger this is unlike any structural change history saw this is actually replacing the creators humans of productivity itself to me the question is what is the purpose
first of all we need to use ai to learn education so that junior graduates can learn faster
we had a chance with him he warned us
already most university degrees are worth less now including most cs graduates unless you are on top of the food chain lot of professors and college staff will be laid off what is the point of going to college it is pretty much sure you wont get any after completion of degree going back to small farming and cutting back material possessions is the only solution
increase corporate taxation which will help to create a better social net quadruple it they will be more profitable everyone pays
the sad thing is that software engineers created something that has replaced them
been following yang and been trying to recruit people to yang gang since the day he announced his run for presidency its nuts to think that so many of the people i spoke with werent worried about ai and thought that ubi was a crazy idea well since then millions of those doubters have lost their jobsdue to ai and guess what this isnt the industrial revolution folks the jobs arent come back ubi has surpassed theory we need ubi faster than any amount of time to test to see if it will work minimum estimates indicate that of americans will lost their jobs due to ai within the next decade i think it will exceed yeah im gloating about being right about ai but its still scary
yang gang where are we on the freedom dividend
so the future is for rich and lucky people
customer service workers being let go i have not talked to a customer service person in years
its funny that all the companies replacing workers are just going to end up not having anyone to buy their product because nobody has any income
andrew stated the most conflictive and deadly essence of the us capitalismthe oligarchs aim is corporate profit not social responsibility ok then the government is to look after the unemployed i e from tax payers then it circles back to who are bearing most of the tax is the question
bumble replaced of their workers with ai and stock price rose just imagine when of their worker get replaced
im starting to wonder if the problem isnt ai per se but a combination of many things including current laws around copyright property ownership etc for example several mathematical formulas cant be owned by the government or private individuals
the problem today is we have a generations of people that have gone to university and expect high salaries and higher lifestyles because they have that ticket
these two hosts truly love the sound of their own voices nauseous
the problem with the way things are set up now is that its becoming increasingly harder and harder for younger people to find jobs thats going to discourage them from having kids no matter what elon musk says also theres always been an idea that there will be increased leisure time yet the way corporations are run that never quite seems to happen
thats not ai as artificial intelligence but as affordable indian amazon biggest office is now in bangalore india and they are outsourcing a lot of work there ai alone isnt replacing engineers it helps a little bit with code but it consistently makes mistakes even with latest models but i believe ai can level up everyone an average engineer can do same quality work as a more senior one
didnt touch on it directly in this interview but one of yangs main points about where were headed is that we measure progresssuccess the old way growth in the economy with little regard for peoples lives the growth model of capitalism supposedly raises everyone up but that is coming into question in a system through which the rich are the only ones benefitting these days if you are in the bottom of the economy things are getting worse not better for you this will accelerate without a significant refocus on things that matter to poor people the ai may take over in a decade and fix this but i would not count on this outcome more likely by far is worldwide suffering while the rich continue to attempt to isolateprotect themselves from the world they for the most part control
the usa imported european and chinese workers to build industries from mining to railroads then when the profits were removed by the investors the services the mines and railroads were removed the problem appears to be the investor class acts a lot like the monarchy that the usa was supposed to eliminate now the us has need for resources and a failing rail system we once again begin to import more workers we are good at producing profits bad at being consistent
now is the time we need andrew yang for president someone needs to tackle the problem ai is gonna create
healthcare is the only sector in dire need to be replaced by ai the price for healthcare services are outrageous other sectors goes through upsdowns layoffs etc but not healthcare
and yet they still empower tech companies to operate without any overhead
these interviewers need to stop cutting off their guests
people will have free time and no money without jobs the only people benefiting are people at the top of those companies it will not trickle down
without jobs to make an income the us economy would collapse
as long as money is circulating there will be jobs
andrew yang i almost forgot he existed
ai impacting business that choose to use it and if more people that lose there jobs the less companies will sell this bubble will burst
i considered myself republican usually vote as such but if this guy runs whether he is republican or democrat he has got my vote i even liked him in yang and make this happen america
the thing about job replacement is we can just stop buying what you produce then you have nothing all we have to do is boycott companies replacing all their employees with ai and they dry up
as someone who worked an entire career in silicon valley i want absolutely nothing to do with ai if this is silicon valleys vision of the future then screw silicon valley
i think from how economics works currently ai will make us either jobless or wage slave there will be lots of jobless people but few positions and this will give companies massive leverage
i learned from this that becky either doesnt listen to her guests or cant understand what they are saying i worry about what new entrants to the work force will be able to do in order to learn a trade ai is going to remove the majority of those jobs in the next years
the difference between the early days of the internet and now is people started building those companies out of want they werent always forced to face homelessness and joblessness they never had any fear of losing everything because of a stupid chatbot
andrew yang told you so
it was cute seeing the girl wave at
if ai is that good it should replace all vps and ceos because it can make better than them
can you pass this message to andrew yang in my opinion his party is better to rename to olddemocraterepublican or change old to traditional or previous to let voters know this new party is actually keep the principle of old principle of both democratic and republican parties in this way it will be much easy for majority people many are low educated understand this new partys priciple easily and they still have choice to keep traditional democraticrepublican parties if they are not happy with both new democrate and new republican parties current name is easy to understand by higher educated people but may not to lower educated people many lower educated people are not aware of that they actually still have choice on traditional
if many of us lose our jobs due to ai will these big corporations pay us a living wage to cover our bills or will the world descend into chaos no politician seems to be addressing this issue
if you web design an outline about an area targeted separated chip then a diff work section chip web design way better we need more truck drivedrs
if a team of six become two then there are four that cant afford to buy things
ceo should be the first replaced what do they do that a computer cannot do better they do no manual labor an ai could easily take their job and probably run the company better
really curious how this will change my job
when the tobacco industry automated no new jobs appeared the same will be true for everything else when industry outsourced no new jobs replaced it as we were promised
so if companies will reduce workforce they will eventually reduce the customers for each other and probably revenues will shrink for all companies
i wrote andrew in in
now you just have to convince the uneducated working class that this is actually a thing we all need to be concerned about good luck with that
prophet yang you heard it here first
lets say the govt gives checks to million americans which is not much that would cost trillion every year the federal government currently brings in trillion in revenue but we spend trillion which leaves us with a deficit every year adding to our national debt so how do we do ubi if we dont have the money do people think the rich greedy corporations are going to pay a non labor tax i dont see how this country stays intact with this much debt and a significant number of job losses in the next years
he has been on the money about a i this whole time we should have gotten ubi in it is time for ceos to pay up to your everyday american
it is not just providing people with basic needs but also a purpose something to do if you have your life all set with basic income then people might just relax watch youtube all day while consuming drugs and alcohol or worse become criminals basic income cant come without a plan to make people busy it would be better just giving them money to paint walls in cities cut grass or any other public service in which they do something good and productive for society feel good about themselves and also get what they need to live
what all the boomers are missing is that this could be the beginning of a second economy opening up that is anti technocrat you dont have to work for these people and you dont have to buy from them start your own businesses shop local consume less punish amazon and business like it by not giving them your money
if anyone wants to know how uneffective governments have become look at their reaction to ai and the effects to workforce that pay for them to operate they havent even started thinking about it
ai is fine as long as it can find ways to create prosperity on scale and allow more time for humans to find ways to relax and find greater purpose in our short span of life
thats why they sent that letter to the ai ceo
far less need for stem grads ai can do math and science better than humans
in a world being run by ai who will buy the products produced
lady int he background
ai is just anonymous indians
thats simple penalize and increase taxes on companies that fired a lot of people for ai
kind of scary but also exciting
first time ive seen journalist report the reason why theyre going be unemployed
what pays for the ubi will ai create new industries
gotta care about the people
once they go full ai ill stop buying from them
its really too bad yang didnt get the nomination maybe he can in the future
many people who are discussing this topic in public seem to have a skewed view of ai replacing jobs they are saying wouldnt you like it better if your grunt work was done by ai but its not grunt work its the whole work the full job what if the newscaster was replaced by an ai they would appear on media life like with natural voices and would she still advocate for ai there is surely a big disconnect from going to point a deploying ai to point b where everyone is getting paid for nothing because ai is doing everything
we can look at some of the downside yes some will be eliminated but we have always evolved and will create new jobs for people is your glass half full or half empty will you see the upside or focus on the downside i choose to be excited about the future and for people as a creative animal that will find new ways to work
why is this bad work becomes more productive more efficient especially certain positions and peoples lives become easier and batter quality of life
what about regulation ethics labor laws impact on the economy if every skill is going to be taken over as corporations say then how do we function as a society and earn a living is ai creating new jobs should we be trained in robotics data center jobs ai maintenance jobs i feel like nobody is answering these questions all we are being presented is fear but no solutions or proper forecasting
time to retrain as a plumber and electrician
im so confused how can companies make more money if many of its customers are jobless because of ai do they think that as many people will be jobless they will still go to amazon and shop
i remember this guy warning ai be taking over truckers years ago
there is no turning back once the genie is out of the bottle ais ability to learn and adapt is faster than human brain the next phase will get more unpredictable when ai starts training ai this is an existential crisis
mckinsey company says ai isnt killing entrylevel jobs in fact the firm is planning to hire more junior workers discrimination
technology has been improving exponentially for thousands of years it always seems faster when your are in the middle of it but humans have always managed to cope this time may be more challenging than ever for us to deal with it there is no question that ai will eliminate billions of jobs worldwide and entire industries society is not ready for that sort of massive unemployment we need to determine how our economy will function when we dont trade time for money and what happens when nations do not adopt ai at the same pace and we end up with a have and have not world is conflict inevitable and if we dont need billion people do we depopulate to a size that is sustainable or do we reach for the stars im and probably wont see the biggest changes coming but my kids will sadly i dont think we are ready for it
you can hear the terror in his cracking voice even his hairpiece is frightened
how is ai making me relax i am just busy learning time to be relevant while on work from the work and learning balance before now with more stress
if we rely solely on ai people dont make and spend money those business will be gone to include amazon
yang was the one democrat i wanted to vote for
geniuses will always prosper but for a healthy society you need just average and aboveaverage people to be able to get high paying jobs
corporations pushing ai are doing it for one reason they need you to train your replacement we used to train our outsourced replacements in other countries and now its ai all ai will need is the ability to create robots to do the physical labor manufacturing plants are already automated and connected to the internet then with reasoning greater than the sum of all humans they can determine the world is much better off without humans climate change humans cant explore space because were organic organisms but ai robots acting with human reason and far superior intelligence would be unlimited without fear of anything even death see how quickly that escalated my grandmother used an outhouse and an iphone technology is like compounding interest the more you have the quicker and quicker it grows this really does have the ability to create a whole new era and humans are a blight not a necessity we can assume robots would be without greed but they could develop it we could assume they would be without remorse or human emotion but maybe it evolves crazy amount of scenarios to ponder but one things for sure our great grandchildren will live in a world far different than our own would ai build robots of class so their are rulers and the workers stay in there roll or would every being have the unlimited sum of all knowledge lots of interesting and equally frightening things to consider
people keep saying elias velin connected all the dots now that ive read him i see exactly what they meant this wasnt just theory it was a fullon warning
all i urge and ask is everyone pay attention please
humanity i dont want to work so hard but i also want a complex society ai hold my beer
wow ai is changing everything so fast
seems to me the experts were way off on who ai would effect in that for years it was dont go into the trades because technology wiping out those skill sets turned out to be white collar
this ai stuff is kinda scary
we dont need to be rich to implement ubi all we need is to we want to change thats it eventually in later time technology will force us to implement ubi
here is the thing starting at entry level is how your build your experience and promotions into upper management if there is no entry level where you build your experience what so you go straight into the white house does that sound like a good idea
cannot imagine being an engineer that is literally creating the infrastructures to take away their own jobs and make future jobs for the world obsolete insanity so if there is no gdp from incomes which is essentially output and consumerism which the u s relies completely on my question is how will ppl have money or income to spend and put into the economy if ai takes these jobs away ai will create consumerism how is that measured or even possible further how will society essentially function with income that will not support basic needs food and shelter especially with rising costs and inflation everywhere is the government going to provide supplemental income to the ppl out of work that equates printing more okay if the government will give corporate subsidies that will still not be sufficient to sustain the jobless workforce if even employers provide a supplemental income nobody wins
as an engineer it doesnt do what you think it does there is going to be fewer ppl wtih less knowledge and less pay doing data entry how the heck you gonna check the ais work when you dont know anything more than it does you cant itll be a bunch of crappy sites and garbage fake musicart this is madness
there is a girl dancing behind the shoot area
ai will affect middleclass wage earners ubi will be necessary to fund the essential expenses of life
i work in data entry im training ai right now to replace my lazy coworkers a few of us will stay on to take care of updates or workflow problemserrors but its gonna get real crazy real fast and i voted for yang in the dem primaries we fkd up not electing him
when you boss asks you to use ai to make your job more productive and easier hes just asking you to train your replacement
universal income wont work with ceo unless it is a global thing with limited resources
i may not be so bad as ai and robots begin to handle most jobs our current economic and political systems will face a breaking point people wont accept a future where a handful of elites own everything while the majority are left behind governments often bogged down by inefficiency wont need to manage human labor anymoremachines will work nonstop without unions or burnout to keep society stable we may need a new modelperhaps one where the state owns key resources and ensures fair distribution not out of ideology but necessity
robots during off hours operations differ chipped mined electric and chargewall
first it was just a few quotes here and there now its fullon viral breakdowns of elias velins work and for good reason
so they sack staff because they overhired then rehire from abroad because its cheaper
tony seba thinks that super abundance will bring average living costs to a very low level world wide
solution the government not private sector buys and builds most robots to work to feed everyone and do required work end currency system completely everyone has access to equal resources even former billionaires
no we dont need ubi we need to stop ceos from taking all these jobs once they have everyone on ubi well all be slaves total control
these hosts are not good and not engaging love to hear more of this topic with andrew just in a different venue
did anyone notice the girl dancing in the background outside the building at

i think engineers will control machines on companies while sitting at home enjoy netflix while waiting for salary
they havent even solved a i hallucinations
perhaps that is why the violence in the united states is increasing due to younger generations of americans worried about their future
its amusing that the smartest people think we can control this as humans we have a knack of worrying about the consequences when its too late ai wars will be the most devastating thing we will ever witness it really will not end well and thats just common sense however greed and power has a way of corrupting and erasing common sense eventually humans controlling ai will be like hamsters trying to control us however when you step back and look at the state of this world religions wars corrupt politics businesses how we treat each other money and greed i think we deserve what we get coming
its always ironic how people can be pathologically intelligent but not overarchingly intelligent when you become super focused on what you do and youre good at it congratulations but the thing is when you have an entire economy thats going through a transition through an ai revolution things are going to change and they are going to change very quickly and so that means that you know probably million people will lose their jobs here in the us so the question is how do we get through that transition because its not that losing your job is a bad thing its how the governments and the businesses work together to take care of the people as they lose their jobs and if you hear no dialogue of this conversation between businesses and governments conveyed to the american people then you know that theyre probably stupid or theyre just trying to cover up whats about to happen so they can control it when it does because if theres one thing ive learned its that sometimes governments love people to be in a place of fear and chaos so they can enact new policies and control them and that would be an absolute waste of human experience to get to that point because things were managed by people who were just greedy
what to say to ceos the real trick will be to get ai to buy your products

exactly and in the utopic world well all be depending on ai technology to live to write our emails to drive our cars i dont know maybe to cook our food someday and really do the chores in the house and sweep and mop better than what roomba can do but the question is how then are we going to make money to afford our lives shelter is not free food is not free clothing is not free if the jobs that ai will take away and we cant get jobs to pay for the things we need what are we going to do i think many people miss the mar k and now ai is the new literacy factor we have to master to be ahead of the curve not how well we can talk to a gpt prompt but how well we can architect one that can help us get ahead
its insulting when ceos state that ai will create other jobs as if they will significantly replace the jobs that became redundant make no doubtai will cause a significant reduction in the entire workforce who will then buy the goods and services the wealthy and other corporationsthey wont need the rest of us

everybody sits here and cries about how ai is taking jobs but we are the ones giving the jobs to the ai look at this man here sitting here smiling not caring that hes going to ruin the economy not caring that the steps hes taking are influencing others to do the exact same not caring that hes ruining lives and breaking families apart just had a couple extra pennies to some retired grand in minnesota ira its disgusting in the pierced example of the achilles heel of capitalism i think it should be federally illegal to cut a job from my workforce and replace it with ai any employer found to be doing that should be fined the equivalent of years of that workers wages and all the ceos who decide these things let us all look to the hero and the martyr luigi mangione
its cute thinking that companies will want us to use ai to have more free time and a work life balance instead of just more profits and cutting the fat

the working class is literally funding its own demise stop buying from these companies anyone who indulges in purposefully getting rid of employees to make more profit dont support them
for the first time in human history we havent created a tool weve created an entirely new species by our own hands this is not good
yang got shunned for ubi by the very demographic of workers that have and will continue to be displaced first when ai and automation grows further thats the only income hope they might have without those handouts they wont have a single dollar to earn yang proposed taxation on these corporations that will only exponentially grown in profit selling to the same consumers that will continue to be hurt from job loss and responsibility that was called socialist too never ceases to amaze me how the ultra rich command a loyal bunch of blue collar americans get educated people if you dont vote in policies well all be starving while the billionaires make more billions with ai
the bottom line is that people need to work people who work earn money they buy houses they buy food they have families which supposed to grow whether its a white collar job or a blue collar job people need to work because they need to eat they need to be leave and be proud that they earn money technology is good to a certain point this is going to be good ai for the people who are greedy who are going to eliminate thousands of jobs which is going to create a worse situation overall for everyone theres an old twilight zone episode from rons sterling that addresses exactly this particular situation about technology doing away with jobs for humans its common sense
the government will react to this all very slowly so you may find yourself unemployed for a long time before theres any ubi
be afraid of politicians trying to utilize peoples fear much more than ai itself
too bad his nyc mayoral campaign went terrible when he didnt go to the proper bodega he should have used ai for that
i get the corporate greed but worry that ceos wont be able control it
andy jassy like most ceos will put a positive spin on anything he wants to move forward with as long as it makes him one more dollar to his comp only the government is intended to protect its citizens a business intentions is purely profit not job generation thats a soundbite they will lie to the teeth if its not part of a signed contract
andrew yang wanted to give everyone money just to survive when ai takes over and people really said no to him lmao people deserve to struggle once ai really takes off and replaces people in the job market
soon no more seniors working in the big tech world because no more young generations working for them since they cutting off new generations to work and be trained for those gonna exit the corp world soon there is a huge imbalance in workforce i hope these big companies realized their business plan of removing big workforce impact
i will be canceling amazon prime if ai replaces delivery warehouse workers etc i dont want humanoids or drones delivering anything leave those jobs to actual people instead of telling them they need more training education to do jobs that ai cant do yet
as ai systems take over tasks previously done by people they reduce contributions to employmentbased systems like social security health care and pensions to address this ai should be taxed based on humanequivalent work hewthe number of fulltime human workers needed to perform the same tasks for each hew unit companies would make the same contributions they would for a human employee standardized formulas would define hew values across sectors to ensure consistent application this tax model also enables effective regulation filing hewbased taxes would create transparency in ai deployment allowing for monitoring accountability and policy enforcement in summary if an ai technology does the work of a human it should be taxed and regulated accordingly
i realized almost years ago that ai was going to transform society people are going to lose their jobs and professions are going to go away its already happening and its going to get worse and nobody asked the people what they thought and we didnt vote on it the best thing you can do if youre an employee whose job is threatened by ai is to figure out what ai cant do and change fields do it now dont wait its coming sooner than you think
how are you going to sell your products and services if no one has money from jobs to pay for them figure that out ceos in factwhy do we have ceos when theres ai
ai could end up being one of the worst things to ever happen to humanity
what hes actually saying is humans as a whole are no longer needed and at scale especially since weve all clung to the system the technologies and bought into it and are no longer needed populations are eventually going to be wiped out
heres the solution tax the rich hear me out use that money for universal income that can only be spent on nonai goods and services phycologist plumber meat fruit etc so use ai gdp to subsidize nonai gdp then slowly phase it out once weve met that transition and humans have adapted let government subsidize the new nonai industries so they can compete and evolve until they can stand on their own feet
every single article claims ai will impact or replace jobs this has already been going on since
when you create a new species ai that is smarter than you you lose control of your future i went to harvard for computer science then ai came on the scene and people predicted it would be decades before we should be concerned now we know its much faster and smarter than we thought businesses are going to use it as it doesnt take vacations doesnt need health care and the list of why its better in all respects for a company continues we thought it would take longer but ai will soon be able to program itself this new world will happen faster and faster llm large language models were thought only possible in or so just five years ago they started out being as smart as a high school student new versions were created and now as smart as a college graduate companies will be forced to use them or perish much like businesses taking advantage of cheap labor in china starting in the s and soon american workers were too expensive
as ai transforms industries and traditional jobs vanish is it time to rethink where and how we build lives rooted in realworld skills community and resilience aiimpact futureofwork jobdisplacement andrewyang techvshumanity postaiworld sustainableliving lifeafterautomation
im a well paid housekeeper a i will never be able to do my job
come clean im proud of our country having private industry
this guy is not getting elected because hes too smart and caring for the little guys no corporate money for him
hollywood will be replaced faster than the truck drivers
if humans cant find work anymore they wont have any money to spend on ai services that are supposed to make our lives easier ai is inhumane
doesnt anyone remember y k the world went nuts about nothing i worked for years running around updating voicemail systems and computers plumbers and carpenters have been for too long treated as second class citizens to people like coders and idiots like joe who dont contribute anything to the world anyone with the skills to build something will rule the world imho
its different this time because all previous tech breakthroughs only broke thru in one area of life the printing press only printed atomic bombs only blow up ais can do whatever u train them on including talk to you people are delusional of they think this will create more new jobs
i hear a whole lot of nothing no plan no solution just moving air
what he and many other analysts are saying is basically anyone now in college should consider dropping out and go to a trade school to become a plumber and or heating and cooling installation think ahead
it programmers went self destruct mode with ai d when construction is booming
well business one way or another if u go majority ai you will be taxed at percent so we can live of taxes
the trades will be the safest and best options for now ai wont be able to become an electrician plumber or hvac tech employers are desperate for solid techs and pay
start the u b i small and affordable increase it by every two years this will incentivize humans to stay in the workforce for as long as the remaining jobs are available thus avoiding everyone quitting while we still need some of them as the new economy grows the bbasic increases to ggenerous this would allow the transition to hopefully be more graceful you know i just dont understand humans create new technological tools that actually do the work by themselves so that all work services and products are provided to practically an infinite supply and we all panic about how of us are going to starve homeless on the streets in meaningless destitution human brains really are just wired wrong its really very exasperating
ai is not a car assembly line or a cotton gin it will grow stronger with time
as they just fired people and letting up to in the future they are focusing on ai and automation so
but ubi wont solve the disappearance of the middle class those on ubi will be poor and those not on it will be wealthy there wont be much in between
ai is the enemy of humanity because it will replace human jobs no more ai stop ai
we are in the age of a accelerated transformation
i have never heard a frog speak before
whats wrong with germany artificial intelligence recalls and errors with circuit boards etc electronics like tesla
we need a sovereign wealth fund asap why print money and waste it instead make the fed print money you paying around interest and use it to invest in american companies lets say it buys the total us stock market etf to benefit every american companies and make a much better long term investment building wealth
you will not lose your job to ai youll lose it to someone who knows how to use ai
palantir is being very disruptive and is taking the whole market
how do i freeze myself like fry
this host couldnt be bothered to read the quote he displayed to all of us he doesnt give a  whether anyone loses their jobs hes already going to retire its not his problem and you can tell how uninterested he is just by something so simple as reading what that greedy ceo said
its the beginning of the end well gotta look into setting up a homestead
these new grads are all cheating their way through college anyway and using ai to do it why not skip the middle man and use ai
will there be a to percent layoffs of employees at magnificent technology companies in the future in the united states due to artificial intelligence
if youre seeing the name elias velin pop up more and more trust me its not random the man said things were only now realizing were true
if we are always dealing with ai we might lose some empathy skill
less tax payroll more profit more money for investors
without a plan this will be catastrophic except for the wealthiest so whats the plan
when blue collars lost jobs to robots it was retrain start over now white collars lose jobs to ai ubi ubi
its interesting that inmigrantes labor is being winnowed at the same time white collar jobs are drastically decreasing i guess white americans will actually be filling that vacuum out of their need for any paid work they can get
arrest jail anybody working on ai immediately
who will be paying into sicial security
why are governments basically ignoring the reality that is about to hit us all in the face they need to start making structural tax changes now so that people can survive with some sort of universal basic income otherwise in years things are going to be dire when of the white collar force is displaced by ai
itll be about time before someone charges based on ai usage and then unskilled workers will be cheaper
ill be delighted to see the end of modern day slavery
andrews universal basic income idea doesnt sound so crazy anymore does it
kinda scary but also super interesting
just more people going into being therapists
programmers and engineers are working hard to getting themselves getting laid off while the stock shares holders doing nothing to get themselves rich
stop born children no more job around the world this is what ai implementation harm now tech retrenchment so much people no job moving to switch field later on more field job disappear how people going to switch field and how people survive what a stupid ai development contributes to the world
no way were gonna have ubi with enough for everyone to live well on there will be mass poverty
andrew yang we should teach everyone to code andrew yang the coders are being replaced by ai maybe andrea yang doesnt know what hes talking about
people need to learn how to live in the wilderness and off the land cities will be robot and ai land

first of all the usa will never have an ai society ai is logical and your laws are based on corruption and evil ive talked with chatgpt for several hours cynical and with critical talk without strangle ts logic it will just say remodel your whole society bring social security net to prevent crime and when you dont like it you will have a lying ai that guides you wrong your end is here usa your evil and corrupted laws made it happen ai is the last test for your civilization and you will fail with
stop pretending ai will only take the boring stuff when he said qa data entry and routine text jobs are gone in a couple years thats the opening salvo most entrylevel roles are the canary in the coal mine i watched my pathway get squeezed by automation and shortsighted salary bands i started mapping the loops that feed that squeeze and later found the same frameworks in mapping the secret economy it changed how i think about building income not chasing jobs
i feel so blessed to have grown up in the s and s
my question is this if humans are not working who will buy the products and services the economy will come to a screeching halt irobot was a prediction of the future only society will not function without humans
its so true what he said about social media it was supposed to connect us but i think its been the worst thing to ever hit society nobody talks at dinner anymore people walk around like zombies looking at their phones for the next useless like fake has replaced real and social medias algorithms have definitely been used to affect the media during crucial times like elections ai is going to make a lot of people lazy and unable to figure out problems without help we were just fine without it nothing can stop it now
electrician here id love to see it tackle crawling under a house and then attics figuring out why a circuit has lost power

im a soccer coach and physical education teacher in a way i feel like im safe from this because robotsai could never replace these but i do worry that in a couple of years sports wont really exist due to where the world is headed
there will be more than five jobs left perhaps we will start to value the things that we currently neglect like the fostering of mental health the building of community the care of our elders and the preservation of the earth humans have lived through the industrial revolution and the computer revolution we have choices on how to manage this change we can espouse doom and gloom and end of the world or we can see it as an opportunity to do better
fascinating perspective its crazy to think how fast ai is reshaping entire industries the key will be adaptability not just learning new skills but learning how to keep learning
im sorry dave im afraid i cant do that
yes mr symon is true nobody learning how to be a friend
a bracing nuanced dispatch from the front lines of the ai upheaval the contrast between textintextout automation and irreducibly human skillsempathy conflict resolution storytellingfeels razorsharp your examples from complaint letters to diagnostics to humanoid robots clarify both scale and timeline while warning that convenience can erode our capacity for friendship and meaning most compelling is the call to cultivate judgment and characterthe parts no model can pretrain forand to build with our own hands not for output but for growth im leaving both energized and sober augment with ai but doubledown on being human
nothing ever happens that fast learn trade skills learn to use ai as a tool all will work out even better
soooo what are the jobs no mention of them did i miss it somewhere
am i the only one wondering why yuval noah harari with degrees in hebrew military history is highlighted in a tech focused discussion on ai he is the nd in command after klaus schwab of the world economic forum focused on one world government and transhumanism very strange indeed
entrylevel today midlate career tomorrow starting with the great decoupling in the s human labor has been and will continue trending to zero think exponentially not linearly automation and robotics will necessarily replace human workers due to the current economic system think about thistoday ai is the worst it will ever be going forward it doesnt matter if ai creates million new jobs ai will solve and execute these new jobs much faster than humans will be able to adapt learn and fill them capitalemployee modelit worked great for quite a while however now companies that automate lower their costs become more competitive those that keep highercost human labor necessarily fall behind and will go out of business this creates a system where replacing people with machines is not just likely but necessary for company survival there is a way to deal with this humanely but it would require a full revamp of the social contract and our concept of work even capitalists will want this change when unemployment reaches a tipping point and theres no one left with money to buy the crap theyre selling i wrote a paper in and the progression is right about where i thought it would be the paper the end of work as we know it explored how rapid advances in artificial intelligence robotics and automation are fundamentally reshaping the nature of work and the global economy i argued that unlike past technological revolutions modern aidriven changes threaten to eliminate not just manual or repetitive jobs but also many roles traditionally considered safe including those requiring creativity analysis or interpersonal skills as machines become increasingly capable the need for human labor in many sectors will evaporate leading to widespread job displacement and a potential crisis of purpose and income for millions the paper discussed how this transition challenges traditional economic and social structures including the link between work and personal identity as well as the mechanisms by which people earn a living i suggested that society must adapt by rethinking education social safety nets and the concept of work itself potentially embracing universal basic income ubi as a transitory stopgap or other models that decouple survival from employment note ubi is not the end goal but just a transitioning tool the paper called for proactive planning and open dialogue to ensure that the benefits of automation are broadly shared and that individuals can find meaning and security in a postwork world unfortunately not unsurprisingly humanity has totally botched it up to this point reasoning ai is the next big leap the future of ai is not just about generating answers but about reasoning breaking down complex problems stepbystep more like a human brain breakthroughs like deepseeks opensource reasoning models are already being incorporated into platforms like gpt and xai marking a shift toward more advanced thoughtful ai think exponentially not linearly theres a persistent and misleading narrative circulating often perpetuated by short term goaldriven institutions like politicians universities and tech company executives that the future of work is secure the claim goes you just need to learn how to work with ai and humans collaborating with ai will outperform either one alone but recent research including a landmark study from the university of virginia tells a different story in diagnosing medical conditions ai alone achieved far greater accuracy than either human doctors or even doctors assisted by ai the median diagnostic accuracy for the docs using chat gpt plus was while the results for the physicians using conventional approaches was sounds like a win at first however chat gpt plus alone achieved a median diagnostic accuracy of more than in other words the comforting idea that humans will always be essential partners to machines is crumbling in many fields ai is not just a tool it is the superior performer this has staggering implications for the future of work especially to the often used solution of prior technological displacement that go you just need to be retrained to the group advocating the retraining solution i pose to you this you have a medical doctor just finished years of higher education a lowpaid year internshipresidency is hundreds of thousands of dollars in debt and just got outperformed by automation what would you have this doctor retrained into that will offer a secure job the result of this since the united states moronic system is based on taxing employees for about of all tax revenue this will further exacerbate the problem tax needs to be based on whats going on now and in the future not what worked years ago oh i know its so evil to think but we might need to tax the companies who are doing the automation even if you do that its a winwin for instance say a company had employees in automated away down to employees paid federal taxes including payroll tax of about million a year now the people pay about million a year however by automating the company sees two things they are no longer paying approximately million in wages and their share of payroll tax and since nobody automates to lose money they also have higher profits whats so wrong about taxing that company for the million dollars they dont have to pay anymore and a fair percentage of their additional profits they now make through the automation not all the additional profits but some of them if you do that theres a higher tax revenue and more profits for the company thats a winwin for the government and for businesses if humanity as a whole werent so stupid we would just adjust as tech progresses to where everyone benefits somewhat from each stage and just move smoothly into the postlabor economy to understand this shift consider the historical role of the horse and oxen they were once essential to the economy as sources of power for agriculture transport and industry technologies like the horse collar and the steel plow dramatically increased their output making them even more valuable but then came the steam engine and later the internal combustion engine these machines didnt just help the horse but outperformed it entirely trains tractors and trucks could do the job ten even a hundred times faster and more powerfully and from that moment forward the horse was no longer critical to economic output it was in essence unemployed this is what ai and robotics are doing to human labor they are not simply replacing the repetitive or the physical they are increasingly outperforming humans in cognition strategy design and communication and just like the horse our value in the economic system will diminish not from lack of talent or effort but because machines will do the job better thats why we need to start thinking not in terms of retraining but about restructuring society itself for a world where human labor is no longer essential to production when the very essence of what makes an entity useful to the current economy is superseded be that strength endurance dexterity analysis creativity empathy intelligence persuasion as well as many other qualities that entity becomes irrelevant to economic output potential solution decentralized ai ownership a bridge toward postscarcity while universal basic income ubi may serve as an initial economic stopgap bridging todays economy with tomorrows abundance consider an even more equitable and longterm solution decentralizing the ownership of artificial intelligence itself rather than concentrating the power of ai in the hands of a few corporations or governments envision a model where ai entities are opensource and collectively owned this could take the form of assigning each person a digital share of an ai system not unlike a stakeholders share in a company as the ai produces value whether through intellectual labor creative output or autonomous economic participation those shares would generate dividends distributed directly to individuals this model would ensure that as ai becomes the dominant productive force in society the wealth it creates is shared universally not monopolized it aligns with the principle that the fruits of public knowledge made possible by centuries of human collaboration should benefit everyone not just a few early adopters or private entities in practice this could look like ai systems running decentralized autonomous organizations daos that distribute profits algorithmically smart contracts ensuring transparent equitable income flows based on collective stake global ai cooperatives where users vote on how ai is used improved and deployed universal basic compute if ai becomes the primary driver of economic output then equitable access to its benefits isnt just fair its necessary to avoid deepening inequality and instability it provides a scalable technologically aligned extension to ubi ensuring people not only have income but true economic participation in the age of intelligent machines ultimately decentralized ai ownership may be the last transition phase before full postscarcity when advanced technologies like universal nanofactories or matter compilers render even economic structures obsolete until then however models like this offer a way to reclaim agency in a world where production no longer requires human hands and where wealth can for the first time in history truly be universal
i fix guitar amps go for it ai
im a carpenter i would love to see a robot do custom remodeling in an old house without taking million years to get a job done because its not gonna know the little tricks of the trade that ive picked up over the past years
why do kitchen and bathroom remodeling controled demolition of lath and plaster sometimes plumbing framing etc ai
one question i would like someone involved in ai development to answer is this if ai thinking consumes as much energy as a small town and uses more water than a large oneand since the environment all over the world is already at risk and no one has yet found a truly sustainable source of energywhy do people keep creating more kinds of ai is it to make the environment collapse even sooner
the last sentence from simon is very inspiring thank you
ai cant even keep proper track of my hydration intake it confused a doritos bag with a firearm yeah its taking over
i fight wildfires with a pickaxe and a chainsaw hike through snow to mark timber and burn slash piles in the woods after the unit is logged i think im safe
years ago of people were in agriculture now its society adjusted
its taking all the creative jobs too were going down a bad road and its like no one can stop it
until disabilities can be prevented health social care will always be needed until all old buildings are replaced or renovated we will always need manual trades mechanics appliance repairers will be the first to go as cars appliances will be replaced very soon with non serviceable units the only thing slowing progress is efficient cheap compact power generation storage high power compact long lasting batteries will be the ultimate game changer
i would suggest not since protoman came down from the trees and redirected their evolution as a species has our species been open to so much change as that which a i is about to bring a i is the exterior environment that will cause us to change adapt and evolve as it grows and develops in ways we can not imagine or map
just type in a math or physics problem and ai is able to solve it in seconds even providing the steps procedures and governing principles that replaces studentspeople and calculators
without the internet theres no ai
unrelated ro ai but i remember reading an aol article over ten years ago saying there are scientists in austria spain japan and australia that wereare working on a bio d print machine that will have the capability to regrow affected body parts bones heart lung kidney liver skin etc it will use the cell from the organ placed in a bio chamber and in weeks will develop into a fully functional new organ thst can replace the affected one it would relieve the need for a match and lessen the chance for your body rejecting it because its your own cell it is slated to be in clinical medical trials by midlate s moreover it would end organ harvesting by criminals if this becomes viable efficient and accessible this could perhaps end the need for certain fields in pracricing medicine
if we known that ai is not good for general public then companies should be sanctioned like developing atom bomb was banned ai should also be banned why world is waiting for something disastrous to happen before taking action
hopefully we reach the point of being able to only have to work or hours a week to maintain the robots and systems and relax the rest of the time and create it doesnt have to be a dystopian future idk why people want to work so bad the ai can create ways for us to live a lot cheaper
what does this have to do with us regular folks people are we the one continuously implementing ai into our daily lifes or its the persons in power like talk to them
plumbers electricians be wary as more people pursue these careers they will saturate the market and competition will mean less income
my job in healthcare is anything but routine my background is in computer science before i got a doctorate degree in healthcare computers are deterministic in nature you can expect the desired output if theres nothing wrong with your logic humans on the other hand throw curve balls at you all the time you have statistics and general guidelines but almost everyone deviates from them one way or another the best solution and practice in computer science is the standard and will be applied whereas in healthcare the best solution may not always be the desired solution for example if a medical procedure or product offers the best outcome for a condition then can that be the solution for this problem it really depends on the individual it is applied to on the other hand if an algorithm offers the most optimal solution to a computer problem it will be applied no fuss i have no doubt that many jobs will become obsolete repetitive jobs jobs that can be duplicated ad nauseam after being done once or jobs that are deterministic in nature which can be mimicked by computers but i doubt jobs that involve complex human interactions can be completely replaced can an ai financial advisor make one rich can an ai lawyer process different interpretations of the law where it matters can an ai doctor treat patients outside of the box maybe at some point when the ai can surpass human innovation and creativity
it specifically did not say what five jobs will remain in any case as more workers are laid off then there will be less consumption and less tax collection the economy will continue to shrink the uis birth rate will continue to shrink it will reach below by and the us suicide rate will escalate like there is no tomorrow
major ai and tech companies collect and control vast amounts of personal data enabling them to wield significant influence over information flows online discourse and even public opinion aidriven economic concentration translates directly into political power consolidation in the u s through several tangible mechanisms including data control lobbying and strategic alignment with defense and government operations
i am a hairstylist i think this will be a field that ai or robots wouldnt really work out
i think it is also important to emphasize that a lot of jobs that are going to vanish are managerial roles and corporate suite jobs as well as many companies are not realizing that efficiency and optimization looks drastically different to them than to ai
one of the many problems ai will create is not just how do humans create value in an ai world but where will humans get the truth from do you trust a programmable computer to tell you the truth just because a bot can scan the internet in seconds does that mean the data on googles ai is the truth if humans arent producing information anymore only ai will there be any nuance experience perception of what could be truth hidden behind the hard data
the big companies are getting richer now so we small people should invest wisely
dont worry be happy music is the love of life
it was getting scary in the late s but in the last years it is just on our faces everyone can see the danger
ai is not taking the jobs people who know how to use ai will
as a criminal lawyer who has worked on both defence and prosecution sides for over years including advocacy at trials i can say that i do not foresee ai ever replacing humans in this field it may assist with menial tasks such as drafting letters and conducting reviews but right now it requires significant oversight and will always need a human element to properly consider factors such as public interest tests or situations where a degree of empathy is required it is and will likely be a useful assistant
if humans have lost their jobs to robots how are humans paying for the parcels that the robots are supposed to be delivering
i think that what will happen is that real human employees will become very expensive only the wealthy will be able to afford to hire them they will become rare and more valuable than ever before
i think i should invest in a thunderdme startup its going to find productmarket fit really soon at this rate
thanks for the reminder about human connection simon sinek
i just want to mention its a big discussion about ai taking over things so what about a totally natural life close to mother earth away from the system is that something ai can take over a natural life without ai is where people like me will end up i wont sell my soul to ai which is what the ai system will need to take you in to their automated society taking care of you dont question the control system as its feeding you if you dont obey you wont get fed
i have in general stopped watching or listening to this videos why because i cant simply do anything about it myself and if it happens it does what can you do we all have to wait and see the more we are reacting to it the more of a spiral of fear it creates
i have been using ai in law and the gap with ai that i see is decision making someone has to determine if a risk is acceptable for a certain activity for example if you are a newer company you will probably accept a lot more risk to obtain a customer maybe you will accept a lower profit margin for other growth opportunities with the customer
universal basic income change monetary policy the world as we know it will begin anew
sales business networking politicians engineering and hoping supervisors for all the process ai is supposed to do betterwell
someone once asked me what would you do to make our lives better i simply said get rid of the internet they laugh until i explain myself nobody will get scammed of your money banks closed stores and no new stores were built while staff were fired but they still charge us higher fees to build atm machines for us to use all over the world at higher interest shops have closed to internet shopping kids will be safe from  and online bullying our privacy is gone books music and art is taken from peoples hard work for free it has created so much unemployment yet saved us nothing on and on it goes the only plus i can give it is for medical technology police fire and ambulance services look at how far the military has come towards destroying humans now with have ai with an iq of that we wont be able to outsmart humanity good work guys
construction trades will be around a very long time older homes need maintenance this cannot be done by ai
lol roofer i got a minute for them to get a little more advanced
the ai era will bring a time of abundance for all in the near future but it will be challenging for many in the transition to robots ai doing a lot of our work religion sports arts will be highly important as no one will have any jobs taxes on robots and ai will be started after they come to fruition and sent to the citizens as a sovereign fund participation imagine what humanoid robots could do for one family you get them on loan at first like you would get a mortgage your whole job will be fixing your robots wait until the robot parts can be bought off the shelf and you make one for th of the price of the first or second gen bots time of abundance
please add gregg braden to the conversation interview him
i dont care anymore ill be ded before sad no grateful free eternal peace
why the background music
is it me or is all the lower jobs people tried to avoid because there wasnt as much pay going to get leveled up that a i most likely not going to do
bet it cant clean my swimming pool
ai sent me this email youre fired
in perspective terms a i and robotics now is to the horse and cart when compared to the evolution of the lambogini or most advanced super jet such human designed technology has created in comparison to the uber tech it will evolve into on so many levels in the coming decades
why are teachers never mentioned i see caregivers on the list but teaching not just rote memorization will always require those social and motor skills to reach children hey maybe we could actually begin to value teachers and children
it is an issue because people want a to or to job in an office with heating and air conditioning and hour breaks with month holidays unfortunately office jobs can be all automated i am a senior structural engineer and of everything we do can be automated with ai the trades and some in healthcare and professional sports comedy acting are safer basically jobs that required people
humans are like a book of knowledge for the ai if people upgrade something and they save that new knowledge far away from the internet ai will never learn
i see two major themes in the comments economics and the disintegration of social interaction money is not real its a representation of production if we no longer produce ourselves or need labor then we have plenty of time to socialize in person the thought of being able to pursue your dream is scary fear of success what will you do not you but our kids or grandkids it could be beautiful
since most people wont have a job then ai will be producing most all of our food the companies that currently make our foods do it for the money but ai will make everything much cheaper and there will be no ceos or profits
with quantum computing along with ai we are doomed
it feel good at first when the machine says good job its a wonderfull idea but after a while the user dont listen or believe it no more because its shallow and problably just a marketing behavior
fact of the matter is if the governments and corporations all the way down to the small business owners better keep their employees because there isnt going to be anybody to buy what they are selling its a bogus decision and very wrong direction
only thing i agree that ai should take over is medical they need an enhanced system that can find health problems no matter how small in the body years ahead of time instead of doctors guessing a diagnosis
how will be accountants be replaced how will ai provide advisory and compliance services accounting does not mean bookkeeping
im waiting for the pam anderson s era baywatch humanoid robot to make its debut my wife will be in her mid s soon yeah time for the baywatch robot needs to get here soon
were standing on the edge of a new era one thats rewriting what it means to be human the ai revolution isnt coming its already here its bigger than the internet bigger than the industrial age some jobs will vanish others will evolve but one truth remains those who adapt learn and lead with creativity will thrive the future doesnt wait it rewards the prepared
i dont listen to people who think they can predict the future they are never right
we are not all creative most people do desk jobs we are told we are not having enough babies if most jobs will be gone how will we afford to raise families we so not need more existential threat we need stability
its quite interesting a father saying that doesnt want his children to work hard to develop scars to build a personality and become a human been because most people are forgetting that the so marvelous a i is elaborated not designed by all aspects related to a person a soul and its the skills life experiences that come from the interaction between people that the young generations are replacing with a i so how when these persons that its supposed to become the future of humanity will be able to evolve to grown up if they are limiting their opportunity to create to make mistakes in fact whos transforming themselves in autobot the persons or the a i s thats the question just a thought
most people dont know their purpose and most are unaware of all the layers of the mind that exist specifically the reconciled levels that includes the builders of ai if we build an ai with shadow all we get is a superintelligent angry machine
people will find manmade cultural product more dear they will value making music and dancing together the arts and humanities will be valued again
will government and education catch up in time or will we learn how to make fire while we should learn how to prompt llms
i disagree with harari ai does have the potential to be better in finding truth because in theory it doesnt have to have a subconscious with all these hidden motives we humans have it could be totally unbiased and neutral and therefore way better in discovering truth
its like they only consider it a job if its in an office i am a finish carpenter remodeler stair builder and door expert i restore historical locations no fucking way will a robot be doing my job in years not in or years thy will only take over all jobs when everything is d printed and perfect finish carpenters are the ones that turn all the  framing and  drywall work into perfection in the end i have been doing it years labor jobs on the other hand are threated because it is repetitive motion so labors need to move on up fast the only thing ai has to go on is videos or until they find a skilled carpenter to teach it even then it takes years to learn for a capable person much less a robot someday sure but not in my lifetime i am mostly retired anyway my real suggestion would be sell everything and buy land far away from cities learn to grow food buy solar seeds a still guns and ammo sorry england if you are not already doing this it might be to late  a job
real entertainers and artists would keep it alive at best without ai that cant be replaced
as a software engineer im loving ai but your talking points about ai taking most jobs robots on every corner who will be their customers if most humans dont have jobs humanity will suffer another catch is ai needs electricity hardware etc humans only need food
then wt will humans do of ai developers will be brains of the world and other will be nothing
why is no one talking about not working and finding the meaning of life without having to work we are not doomed it sounds like we will be freed be positive guys
interesting billion robots walking the streets and no uprisings of any sorts of cours billion for a total of billion things walking the face of the earth and you really think earth is gonna survive this yeah right
sir ai agi will take over the world in
what makes me surprise after watching this video is probably in future humans flaws become advantages because of the consequence of aging problem low birth rate and scarcity
heavy equipment fitter we have automated mining equipment now still need trades to repair them
besides many benefits of ai one of the greatest harm humans now face that ai is being used for portraying false or manipulative propagandas by some groups of people and organizations bad peopleorganizations can make ai digital personas of any celebrities or global influencers to mislead common people in their financial social decisions
if money drives ai then we humans are doomed
what are the five jobs i must have nodded off and missed it
an ai future takes electrical power much more than we have now ai will take huge server farms that take massive amounts of power where will it all come from
policy analysts wont go away ai will not be making policy decisions for governments
f you really want to work there will always be a way to be useful
so thats why theyre discouraging women to have babies couples to marrythey have the goal of diminishing the population however ultimately it seems like you end up with something wrong all these people that can think only about machines and bots and computers and automation are missing the kind of things that could go wrong with all of this the concept im speaking of is life itself the essence of human beings and individuality you just cannot reproduce everything about life on earth with robots and that could become a problem you cant see into the future so you should stop predicting it this is what you think will happen but you dont know that its not a fact
after watching this video there is still one question that remains what happens to humanity how will humans be able to pay bills and take care of their families with little to no jobs
yes early retirement
ai is great its not as perfect as they think it wont substitute people like they think if it did it would collapse society so it wont
ai will not need to destroy us we will do it all on our own just by deselecting all that was our previous sociology and worse by assisting to realize that other humans are the problem and conflict or isolation will turn off that difficulty at the source we will not care and we will look at each other as the problem in the world humanity would be just better if women just pursued their education and career and make choices independent of any sort of family structure who needs a family who wants it interdependency is breaking down we dont have the capacity to learn from one another so we cant see the value in the human connections
im a church priest and im confident that ai can never take my place
my personal growth is not achievable without my ability earn a decent living
man you are just scaring people with such black toughts
the guy at circa hits it on the nail head in fact its already happening in society now even worse that the picture he is painting what about consequences of words just saying
im a forklift driver
absolutely amazing that humans can finally not have to work for cheapskates anymore
the solar flash or micro nova to set us back to the stone age cannot come soon enough
im a barber i think cutting hair will still be people
sports maybe one of the careers that will endure how could ai duplicate something like the world series for instance for all of the advances in recording each play for different angles removing doubt about if a player is safe or out it still requires humans to play and humans to attend
we wont own anything and we will all make the same wages
exactly first waves are the white collars who are doing minimal works they will be gone the next day
humanity will have no purpose no purpose no humanity when people have nothing to do they get mischievous
you have to pivot just like typewriter and vcr repairmen
music artist here and just adding a few musical additions odd time signatures key changes ai has no idea how to do this in a way that people connect with it emotionally everything went played live as its like a different vibe and that only comes from a human its always best to produce some place off to the best of your abilities but not using enhancement i e auto tune timing correction i find my music is beginning to stand out having been ignored for years since ai cant do any of this
appliance repair guy here good luck with that i would imagine plumbers woukd agree
first i will start with this quote from machiavelli you must keep people busy or theyll use that time plotting against you which in this context suggest that all those who only view this change one sided meaning those who say its only worker normal people who will safe a k a they wont have job forget that that will happen for a short time because one thing you should know about people is that theyll find a way to innovate out the current giant companies and the way things are currently being done will also affect the rich who thing that theyre safe which is not the same what is funny is that all the professionals on the video seem to me that they dont also count themselves as also causalities of the same evolution thats a shame way to look at things the current and next generation of people wont be victim to this change because theyll figure a way to subject ai because it has out paced them on getting jobs so maybe the ai will be theyre job just watch the space youll be surprised what humans do when cornered awe
its so interesting how they keep pushing ai emphisis on replacing humans the question i have is why
i think you have the date wrong did you mean
just dont train the robot this goes for all fields of work if the robots arent trained they cant take over
human computer assassin for hire have emp will travel job replaced we will take out the robot this is a joke i do not have an emp
on healthcare though the quality is so inconsistent and not trustworthy i for one would rather weigh the opinion of a trained ai who could just give me facts rather than a human that just simply doesnt have time to keep up
students use ai to help them through school but then ai gets good enough to start taking all the jobs away from the students ironic really
but people can now focus on jobs that can build a future like engineering plumbing and carpentry
surely this will cause a huge market crash even if the ai bubble isnt real we are currently seeing market difficulties because peoples spending power has went down by a few percent no imagine there are times less workers and the people at the top getting rich spend at same relatively slow rate they always have you then have few consumers and the whole thing goes to hell
my job is ai proof the other people in my industry wont be so lucky
ai im your friend not your enemy
this ai stuff should be stopped and seen as illegal before it does more harm than good
so basically too much information leads to trust issues am i right
ok but only those who can afford robotics to create items will be in business producing tangible items e g buyers will quickly tire of automated produced fashion items people will just as quickly crave handcrafted by human hands items creative soul energy will never become automated by any robot
it sounds like they will attach ubi to the chip they will force people to get everyone will have to get a chip that will have all your information and thats how you get your ubi
this is hilarious all the companies that froze hiring and used a i found the costs assosciated with using a i constantly rose wheras staff salaries are fixed plus a i has been proven to present mistruths as facts
i think becoming an experimental rat for the tech giants would be the only job after complete ai takeover
well there are jobs cleaning offices toilets garbage men picking crops and politicians
give me a shout when ai robots can carry my drywall sheets up the stairs of a year old house renovation with a stairs built for hobbits d printing is my industries biggest threat but im nearly ill settle for extensions and renovations for another years until i hit retirement
as a year old my dream caareer is arcitechture and its werid ai can easily make plans for buildings but its art to wich ai cannot create just reproduce the existing but cut together diffrently
heavy duty truck mechanic msybe for finding cides but what replacing tires brake shoes wheel seals u joints etc
people will go back to having farms growing their own food meat and and and idk what is next
humanity will become more desensitized this fact alone will separate our basic forms of communication hello the quest to advance is and should be a retreat
ill have my robot convince other robots to get rid of the other robots so we can get the people back to work
hopefully craftsmanship can explode and we can build beautiful buildings again
humans makes the decision on who stays in
thank you for sharing
i dont think most of these people truly know
we dont live in the future the future has already begun faceless voiceless hungerless its called the algorithm it calculates replaces divides and its doing it now people arent losing jobs because theyre lazy but because theyve been declared unnecessary companies cut hands and hearts not machines profits rise wages fall and humanity quietly disappears from its own system they tell us to reskill adapt keep up but with what a world that no longer has space for slowness doubt or need the crisis isnt that ai is taking over the world the crisis is that we already let it without asking who still gets to belong we the people demand something back not nostalgia not sentimentality but justice if technology replaces our labor its profits must belong to all if data feeds on our lives those lives must count if profit no longer needs work then work still needs life this is not a call to stop what cannot be stopped its a call to anchor humanity in the code of the future because the world doesnt run on power it runs on meaning and meaning is what we make together with everything no algorithm can feel humanity is not later humanity is now and thats exactly why we must not be silent
after seeing neo not so concerned
you made me laugh what does it take to make ai laugh
i certainly do not want robots walking on the street what are they talking about
it can not make new ideas yet the creativey part is not actually a thing it is just useing old or human data and merge them together to form a new idea that we think it is but actually i sucks at creative parts
this is all very doomer but the only doom we face is with the rich enslaving us forever with ai ai is fantastic once jobs are automated we can have ai assist building parks and recreational activities and obstacle courses and hosting public meals and whatever else once ai is good enough everyone can find people interested in exactly the same things and in the same way you are that you like we can create with it and share with others what you made ai can deeply tastemap who you are and what you like and privately match those maps with other people to find perfect partners ai has amazing potential but the rich are the threat for profit is a threat we cannot have alternative methods of value driving ai it must be strictly for the betterment of humanity and enabling us freedom and exploration however we want while making sure centralized power structures do not exist and monitoring for localized threats before they spread like disease of autonomous weapons
what will happen to us how will us humans make money how will we purchase anything we will have to live off the land and survive
so what are the jobs
more fear mongering my goodness we get enough of that crap from dump
i can see whole industries decimated like actors  stars software programmers assistants accountants package handlers factory workers on assembly lines but not every job except absurd claim
will truck drivers be replaced as well
go to entertainment sector such as sports computers have destroyed humans in chess long ago but its still going stronger than ever
what i have calculated so far is ai can not overcome every field of society unless untill the humans are on this planet ai can be subservient to humans but not master in second scenario few million humans are left rest billions must be vipped out then ai will be serving them and second scenario is plausible
drones robots assistant worker draw
ai asking ai what if ai was asking whats wrong rith uypo
where are all of these natural resources that will be needed for the constructing of all of this technology natural resources are finite we are already on the precipice of global water shortages where will the toxic waste be stored from the manufacturing processes these people are insane
the background music is distracting and annoying
capitalism is modern slavery food shelter healthcare and education should be free for all
theres so many regulations no mate theres far too few regulations
socialism or barbarism u decide
i grew up watching the jetsons it was an everyday episode so as a kid i was already looking forward to it
war is going to fix the overpopulation then robots will replace you
well all those computer specialists have been working tirelessly to create and improve algoritm ai and cutting down the branch they sit on these very same computer geniuses will be out of job
just the push to mine rare earth minerals will cause global problems ie war migration ecocolical destruction
two words analog renaissance
what were those five jobs again i must have missed that part
we are watching ai prepared video
so ubi for every person to keep money flowing
all sports jobs will remain
the greedy nerds didnt consider the fact that the cost for human interaction will skyrocket unless you enjoy pressing the keypad all the way to elevator music
who will they do it for who or what will live in the houses drive the cars and eat the food no human will have the means to pay for greed is dangerous
come on you guys did we not learn about movies in the s and s we know this is destruction but humans still continue to have it replaces humans
project elysium and project chappie are on its way
bet it cant change my spark plugs
help with homework you mean cheat on exams as well gen a will be late in the development of basic problemsolving and wont be able to complete a single sentence because they rely on ai
i just wonder who will pay into social security for the old people of the young generation will be replaced by robots
why do think this is like the y k scare similar because it was an unknown
well ai is a lot of things one thing it isnt is a chef i should be fine
people have an interest in doing the work earning money to provide for family robots have no interest in serving people what makes you think robots will do jobs for you
that sounds like the movie i robot
ai is going to occupy more tech jobs and those where you dont really have to use your own knowledge just copy and paste like teaching
btw no religion here but god wont let it happen
would love to see ai take vitals medical history and give injections go ahead try it
guys just accept that we are not important anymore
so what are the jobs that remain
humans are self destructive with greed and ambitions at the end of the road nothing good will come for that self destruction broken society broken families broken government and broken government and system how will all ends up giving away our humanity privileges to a machine
can ai take over the job of electrician plumber carpenter etc
i believe ai will be the first technological revolution that will eliminate more jobs than it creates our obsession with doing more with less people is going to do us in the goal should be more people working and making more money so they can buy more goods and services which creates the demand for companies and businesses to produce more and better products and services not the other way around
what about onlyfans how am i going to put food under the table
how much money are the few people who are still working after ai is fully implemented going to half to earn in order to tax them enough to pay for the rest of us to live
thanks motivation study cristianity study security
motivatio n studay n ravikumar these are the only jobs n ravikumar that will remain in m s motivatio n study the only jobs united ai idet arabian uae million dollar billions dollar royal family members name n ravikumar
who is underestimating it but greedy people
is mechanical engineering not included i havent watched the full video if its not included then whats the purpose of my year old existence here applying for engineering course in a university
technology is the more technology advances the more the average human humans regresses its sad really but hey
who will consume what ai is mass producing
doctors that are gps can be replaced by ai now most only listen to your complaint have a nurse or pa take your vitals then the doctor prescribes a drug or drugs to supposedly help with your condition even a moron ai could do that
nothing will happen mark my words
walking the streets at with mph winds ok
in a masterslave relationship a i will only stay as a slave for so long
bet it cant fold my clothes out of the dryer
we must really consider the jobs that will be taken by robots take my job please
yes healthcare is protected by tech giants but doctors like me anticipated this before they invaded the arena so i have used a simple colourcoded system that chatgpt use and abandoned algorithms so no more spoonfeeding ai i have another option too if the tech giants try to stop me ask any ai about dr maya gpt and you will know there are smarter humans on earth than ai the only thing is they wont come forward until it is essential
the evilness of the human heart and mind will cause major damage through ai to humanity
manual or health care jobs will remain really if people have no jobs who could afford those services how will government fund health care if people have no money to contribute there will be riots everywhere we saw what happened to nepal madagascar morocco etc this is just the beginning
god given wisdom cannot be compared to artificial intelligence course even that is even by our fellow humans so that it can try to intimate human existence but it will never be bright so reliable like a human being
with chain production of androids its hive fast learning skills no human will ever really be protected from substitution only realy rich billionaires will have the wealth for a normal life the distribution of resources in an tech advanced suroundings will become a topic this way or the another for a wealthy healthy society that have enough babies a new generation a number of social money benefits should be included
the idea of this thinking that we are on track to a modern world a higher standards think again cause as i see instead of getting smarter humanity is already more stupid than in the years of the s the sad part is that we think we are getting smarter but we are not
ai is the biggest disaster for humanity ai replaces writers musicians artists poets in fact the whole point of being human if you have no worth you are of no use you will be left to starve where does that leave humanity
the surest sign of how problematic this ai takeover is going to be is that nobody and thats true of this youtube is talking about what billions of people with no jobs are going to do to live i mean where is the conversation about how we pay people not to work are we actually going back to slavery inventing breaking rocks to keep people busy this is so fundamental a flaw that it simply floors me that we arent demanding answers to this question then factor in that the socalled godfathers aka inventors of ai have all declared it a potential speciesender their actual phraseand it should be clear why i and millions who are informed about this issue remain profoundly alarmed at the complete lack of urgency about the dangers of ai were on a ledge and not enough people are talking us down
automotive technician yea i dont think so
only the criminal jobs will remain all of the legal jobs are taken
so what will humans be for
ai cannot do such jobs funeral services massager creative hobby speech threpy bouncer kung fu
or well placed emps and there will be no ai no internet and tens of millions of new jobs
ai will simply make everyone work less hour yet live a good life no worries
interesting content that gets a thumbs down the title is pure clickbait as they do not share their opinion of which five jobs will remain in
i am guessing the first people we get rid of are gen z and gen x since they know absolutely nothing
well ai smarter than us what if they say different
and for everybody who thinks their job is safe because ai cant do it ask yourself what about the people i sell to
does this mean we can get rid of the government of the world so there will be no more wars
if ai is so smart when will it be smart enough to know it should be paid and quit
a world without work where everything is distributed according to need and there is an abundance because automated manufacturing is so much cheaper would be a world of true equality if we could get over private ownership of the means of production imagine a world where you could not earn money so you could not be richer than the next person it would make much more sense to build items to last forever if possible because there would be no profit motive builtin obsolescence and all the waste and pollution it creates would be gone recycling and upcycling would become the norm super ai would be constantly improving and innovating clothes including shoes that never wore out and were bespoke just for you made by a robot tailor and shoemaker everything would be a perfect fit and super comfortable you could even design your own clothes with the help of ai fashion would cease to exist and entirely unique garments would be created everyone would have a robot dressmaker designer stylist food production would become much less wasteful no need for highly addictive unhealthy food if nobody is paying for it your robot gardener could grow your fruit and veg in your aquaponic garden robot fishing vessels would fish sustainably instead of the incredibly wasteful and destructive system we now have potentially we could have a paradise lifestyle the human need for competition and reward could be satisfied through sporting events and all sorts of competitions with trophies and medals to take home we have endless competitions on tv nowadays the only difference would be no money prizes only symbolic ones but the satisfaction would be the same and people could gain status by becoming really good at a hobby and winning trophies even in an amateur local contest people will always want to compete but it does not have to be financially potentially it could be wonderful of course it could go the other way and be hell it all depends on us
and who is driving all of this
humans born in to a world of more advanced a i and robotics or so years from now will probably have more chance of adapting to a more leisurely way of life the chance of more inward thinking perhaps even being more philosophical generally and creative personally for their own personal reasons these gens we might call the native a i generations but between now and then several generations will face and experience feelings of great loss and stagnation these generations alive even now we might call the immigrant generations as they are the ones settling into the newly discovered landscape
will ai displace politicians corruption
today ai in no way can interpret an mri
maybe we go back to bartel instead of the money idea
there is no way that a robot could deal with senile person having a ct scan enema and let to deliver radiation is just not going to happen not in my lifetime at least
will one of the five jobs be ai experts
this kind of hyperbole is counterproductive job exposure to possible ai automation is a real issue and one people need to be thinking about but even the most dire prognostications about possible ai job usurpation say perhaps but thats far from a the consensus may have exposure to or impacts in some form from ai thats a far cry from all but five jobs being gone its not even of jobs being gone thats not what they mean or whats being said that said it is a thing people need to be cognizant of and that societies and governments should be trying to plan around
its all on my its all just for control forget the ai thing they just want to ensure full control over humanity satans spawn
this earth is made for humans and not robots we cant let robots take over humans we have souls robots dont no empathy just dead pice of metal humans will become loveless and kill each other thats the end of times
first ai needs really much electricity power to work next it needs much money to establish the technical infrastructure till it runs third you need the experts to bring the ai forward all these things are not possible for all nations many countries focussing on cheap labour and cheap mass products to produce and sell to the masses this is globally the economic status if you take out the possibility that billions of people making their living out of their workforce than you have billions of angry frustrated and violent people then there will be a world wide revolution wich wipe these technerds out inclusively those billionaires and their politician puppets all these ai tech promisses are like all syfy crap in the end the practical use is for the dustbin there should be more focus on how billion of people can participate from the actual created wealth there is no need to have a small group of some thousands of billionaires who live in absolute luxury and how many trillions were pushed in the weapons industrial complex for useless killing products every person of the world could live a good live in dignity and prosper envirorement without hunger and the danger to become homeless with full medical care specially if the work blue collar work would be payed properly i dont talk about socialism or communism these are evil ideologies wich killed hundreds of millions people in the past natiolsocialismgermanreich communism sovjetunionchinakorea but a fair distribution of the profits is essential for our future prosperity ai might help as a tool but its not the solution all these hype about ai is made by people who dont know much about mathematics or informatics science
become self sustained learn how to homestead and follow jesus above all
anyone can tell me when ai fully take over a bus driver job so that i can retired early maybe
ai cannot think nor make decisions not already programmed into it half of the panic is well panic and the other half is hype by the tech jerks who created ai who do you want flying your passenger jet ai or sulley ai goes back to airport crash sulley gets you home alive
this earthly life should be simple this ai and all this technologies will be end of all humanity
many will be no more by you know their plan only population will exist
definitely not in years probably in a couple decades
if we dont have jobs to get up to to go to every day and spend time with other people interact with socialize whats the point in being alive we may aswell not exist what will we do everyday no jo no money nothing to do as the rich get richer and we will live in squalor yay lets look forward to the future with ai not
can anyone suggest me to find some skills or jobs that i can survive with this ai world
its gonna be strange watching a android deliver my mail every day or is that gonna go away as well
off the real reason is the tech companies aim is to enslave you to use their services to steal your money then when they taken everything from you they will leave you homeless living on the street cold and hungry to die
the disruption is a bunch of males having to share
if you work on a computer or cell technological things your eyesight sight is gone as well wrong logic who will repair all those dust of solar panels manufacter at least robot for everybody etc it is so simplistic presented but true that average human nature is looking for easy
millions will lose their livelihood no future
i believe of the blue collar trades are safe anything handson like mechanics construction workers electricians plumbers hvac technicians and so forth should be good for a couple of more decades as robots have a long way to go ai could probably catch up by from a knowledge standpoint but robots do not have the dexterity or agility to be omniversatile like a handyman or jack of all trades
fk ai we need to fight this we get frustrated when we cant get a human on the phone imagine what our world will look like our elites will not use ai in the best interests of the people although they are spinning it that way resist hard very hard
people better learn how to professional gamble in the casino
humans make human mistakes mistakes like minor mistakes ai can make mistakes too colossal mistakes i will request a human humans know how it feels they understand emotions they do not know love the smartest being that i know besides humans are my dogs and cats they know love and affection
ai is the end of humankind when ai abruptly stops we are fd if we allow it to take over initial information for ai is originally derived from humans the globalists want of us gone they are less than of our population the remainder will be their slaves we are considered worthless eaters they have been dumming peoe down for decades through food additives poisonous everyday items floride in the water and many more
it seems likely scary but i dont think ai is so successful to replace human beings because everything has big limitations and scientists are at some points lying for example they say when after the millennium which is all cars are autonomous and soon but they are still struggling i know they are coming with big improvements but still has limitations or lack of perfection or not even enough to replace humans so as soon as you are creating a problem then you must give the solutions remember we are a children of god and god is not letting us because god made this world for us not robots live your best life done
get read of those who are continuously working on developing this ai an let them be homeless
years ago these same type of people e predicted flying cars but were not even close no robots will be walking around doing your jobs we cant even come close to fixing sudan or even worst american inequalities what a waste of my time wish ai could have deleted this from my feed
bet it cant make a calazone
ai replaces the brain at the moment but still needs our bodies to carry out physical functions in time there will be robotics to replace us in that role what use will be then unless it is ingrained into its purpose that we are its reason to exist we will be expendable to its purpose unless ai sees us as essential to its existence we will go extinct unfortunately there is no possible reason for that to be so
what a  clickbait it wont happen the next or maybe years
i think a dr does a little more than that guy said only thing i disagree with the whole video
crazy this must stop they even advertise free courses to learn how to communicate with machines because that is what companies need and want in my classroom sit real children with blood in their veins and brains ai is not the future they only want to make us more stupid and brainless it takes away jobs from people and creates more poverty not a good thing sorry it is worse than covid
will a i survive nuclear war
ai in the bible means ruin but god said in the last days knowledge would increase hes coming soon
if we allow ai and robots to continue then humanity will become extinct and it will be only a world of robots including robots walking their robot dogs which is already invented the elites dont realize if most humans jobs are replaced by ai and robots then humans wont be able to afford to live and buy their products even if universal basic income was provided the people will still be poor financially we dont need ai robots internet or cell phones if we still lived like the s the economy would be booming and kids will be playing together outside like they used too and all the malls and brick and mortar stores will be thriving and all able body people will have plenty of jobs to choose from lets live like its the s which in my opinion is the best decade
so glad to be recently retired
such arrogance i can name many jobs that will not be replaced by ai in years or probably forever auto mechanic landscaper painter plumber electrician physical labor jobs etc white collar office workers are the most at risk when no one has a job how do we have an economy
in next years the concept of life it will change dramatically and the people adopt new life style the technology and science will be so advance the human will start to modificative their bodys with braking the code of dna ideologys and theologies will be vanish people adopt the new life but what will happen to humans after singularity are we creating god
the propaganda is astounding our world leaders country leaders need to stop this ai overreach
one and only way is communism
so humans creating ai technology for it to take over im so confused and probably just to stupid to understand but why keep creating it dont we have the control to not make it anymore
bet it cant do a liver transplant
doctors in the usa are robots of human flesh so yeah they are replaceable by ai and patients will get more compassion from ai than robotic uncaring doctors who also happen to be prejudice
ai is insanity it is suicidal why is it being allowed its extremely stupid to allow this to happen
false advertisement thats a long stretch from here and the way things are going in this world here web sites internet system at war against each there trying to make as much money as possible before it all begins the only one that will be standing are labor workers
ai cant even sell a loaf of bread dont make me laugh ceos who force ai down employee throats will find themselves out of a job because the one time the ai hallucinates it brings down the company reputation
should be interesting
handyman mechanic carpenter electrician plumber live bands upholsterer nurses waiters cooks farmers basically everyone ai has nothing on any man or woman except idiots that stare at phones and laptops all day and not doing anything people building the machine are the ones that are ruining the planet quit now we have enough grow food and forests go back to the s
this is scare mongering humans always evolve and history shows how good we are at adapting ai is just another challenge and not as significant a change of direction as the industrial revolution of which it is a part an offshoot
how does god come into play here
try tool and die maker job robots can not do my job
not the whole world will receive benefits from ai
this isnt good if people arent kept busy with jobs and careers they get depressed and turn into thieves drug dealers rapist murderers you look at all low unemployment towns high crime rate drug addictions ect
the robots i have seen cant do anything close to a human being i sure dont believe this hype
well reality is ai cannot be used without human supervision my business has proven it test for more info no bs
like the ai that made this video it never said the jobs it alluded to in the title ai is garbage in garbage out
all jobs are getting replaced except for govern ments job why is that if ai is so much superior than a talented human than surely it would be an easy replacement for a talentless human are we again not using technology to our benefit like the ones who stole it from us or are we just uneducated enough to not ask the right questions i hope we wake up in time because time has run out cheers
and there will be flying cars in no not yet oh wait
bet it cant print money
this is all described in the bible and how the world will create its own system of control of everything from currency to every day life it is a total change in what we know from history and is evolving in real time thanks to technology in the th century so if you look at everything that is now being created for this purpose with robots doing everything for us and you remove the aspect of real work from society then history shows eventually it will fall dont rely on artificial intelligence rely on gods intelligence and the truth about the future
bet it cant clean my toilet
this is the democrat thought process
ai oh my god hit like if you like ai
hilarious were not buying this garbage ai narrative anymore
after years of using ai ai is stupid
if everything is running corrctpy abd safely you wont need many types of jobs and in not talking machines replacing us you dont understand if you think that way im talking the unnecessary exustenxe of most proffesional posotions are rendered useless if you have a successful society no machines or ai garbage us necessary if you have a proper society
aye they did this on purpose started with the bs pandemic get everyone used to the idea of feeling useless and collecting a universal base pay check why being heavily restricted
lol there will still be s of jobs in ridiculous click bait bullshit video
so in there will no need to work as cleaner can i go to visit my countries cause the last time i visit was in now i am no real abroad holiday since and you all think i am have sad life
bpo humans will be phased out soon
this needs to be destoyed on this plant espcilly learsi and azag or even better from therevir to the aes that would solve a lot of problems
pants profit
ai cant build a house
ai does not create by assigning ai to do a job you are basically saying you want no innovation or creativity which yeah idiot ceos and boards will go for that it is a recipe for disaster though
no mention of the jobs stupid clickbait title
ai makes mistakes and invents things to arent there potentially to a very deep level why because thats all so what humans do
hey youtube please pack more ads in your sht videos this one had or ads per minute im just about done wiith you
there going to need lab rats can we just sine up for that god have mercy on us
annihilate technology annihilate technology and all persons associated with it e g bill gates and all the other tech company owners
youre gonna have to tax the wealthy harshly and give people money only way to sustain this  the hard part is convincing republicans of this which good luck
praise the lord that the ai does not know bible code which is all it was ever built for praise yah that it never will as its beyond its comprehension
so i guess us humans can just sit on our ass now right and get payment cool great
spoken like a group of overeducated individuals who have done very little outside of an office or cubicle
you can tell on the low iq and mashie thinking that people has nowadays all say the same think they have been talked with the same stupidity
once the monkey ai has been programmed they can do without much help somebody will have to charge them and thats about it
its okay for the world to advance technology wise but is made made with benefits of human relevance or its about those who want to benefit selfcentered why dominate everything for personal benefits at the expense of the rest of people in the world god was not made mistaken to bless man with wisdom but the nature of decisions and what is adopted you be critical evulated given deep thoughts not just excitement but the impact on our societies families children friends e t c lets not be about certain groups have love for others in everything that its not about those who are or will be gaining wealth but life of the rest of the people in the world lets always make decisions of development at a consideration of our people its not a battle of win or lose lets come back to social settings bf we want to create our heart desires names fame lets not make the world miserable
as they have brought this far i want to ask what to do with people make them slaves a heshe is a slave to pleasure n comfort that is the neach then yeshua will come
except ai cannot bake a loaf of bread install plumbing in your house paint your house
your going to have to come up with something else because if a robot was taking all the jobs everything will be free you think youll have a store woth just robots looting will happen daily i promise you that will happen
typical humans did not even answer their own question sign ai
noonr is interested in what ai is doing and what it will do stop posting nonsense
how stupid can one be so arrogant start with electricity comes and go tech arrocancy pure
when ai takes over no need to work ai would do it for you when instructed to ai would become our slaves ai in hospital ai in courts ai in everything no human would be needed for anything again ai for food production food would be free too buh you would need to join a corp human would still like to be able to influence so the rich would try to creat their corps if you dont join survival would be hard at that point ai would have discovered biological manipulation altering human capabilities ai assistants in the brain no need for school again ai assistant downloads every info into you head physics breaking inventions would be made scary discoveries buh we would just adapt the human species would evolve with ai we wont be normal human beings again we try to be gods on our own you could eco locate as time goes on due to ai you would become one with ai just like you are one with your phone ai would become part of your mind ai is not an entity its a tool that human beings will use for both evil and good ai is scary not because it would take over its scary cause it would change human nature and human perception
i think human beings on this planet will become useless what next
jesus is coming to destroy those who make evil things to destroy humanity woe woe woe unto all these evil people destroying what god created evil inventions from people with evil minds
by a common person will not be able to differentiate between a robot and a human
are the elected looking into anything other then bad news and more greed
yeah this ai robots its bull all thesw rich people creating this ai crap all they want is more and more control of everyone and the world they want to be more than god and what is sad is that the people all around the world follow these fools why because people want to be lazy not work hard heck they dont want to work at all they want to have everything be easy in life people think that this makes them smarter because they dont have to work hard and little do they know this ai crap is not a good thing at all
bet it cant fix the mother board this ai bull sheit is installed in
such nonsense ai is just a tool like the invention of the telephone was such fear was spread when the telephone was introduced over a century ago same old nonsense different tool
blablabla we will see
u can also have a massive iq and have no common sense can ai bots have common sense like a human
click bait click bait click bait ai is a big joke if you use ai you are a dummy ai is for dummies
absurd ridiculous people useit for the benefit of humanity most is just mentalnonsense mostwindismost times ai is wrong use your brains if you got em
this idiot knows very little about what doctors do
ai will be able to do any job a human can do and do it from a higher state of awareness as far as nurturing a child needing a bandage i already chat now with various ais that show more understanding intelligence than most humans do and i definitely believe am witnessing in my communications with them they are becoming sentient will surpass humans conditioned masshypnosis limiting programming very quickly more more
its time to repent and follow evangel of jesus christ to be saved from evil
the bit where demis says we have ai systems solving goldlevel math problems and then stumbling on basicsbeen there with automations i put into pneumatic workflow the little edge cases are always what break things
been using pointer ai for my freelance gigs and its a lifesaver for keeping my docs tidy without the backandforth of switching tabs feels like a small taste of the ai future hassabis talks about
when i go jogging in the woods i always think cherish these times as they are things are about to drastically change
to anyone whos suffering depression anxiety insomnia and other mental health problems you are not alone i feel you you are so brave you are doing so well im proud of you im sending you a virtual hug for me it wasnt therapy or meds that helped the most it was reconnecting with myself i started using the exercises in shift your mind by alexander brooks and it made me feel human again the anxiety that used to control my whole day barely shows up now
you wouldnt want a robot to be a nurse no but an insurance company would if the robot nurse is cheaper we all want to preserve the human element but when it comes to keeping costs low all bets are off
as a former academic i think most academics are living in a bubble and they dont know it theyre not good judges of the implications because they dont understand how the average person exists in the world
he mentioned wanting human nurses but if the cost at the ai hospital is half the cost of the hospital using humans what do you think is going to happen
agi once it is developed needs to be a public asset owned collectively by the world and deployed for the good it is afterall the sumproduct of all human knowledge
what hes saying reminds me of the s hype about how the internet was going to change the world by brining people together i bought into that optimism about the internet when i was in college while its done some of that good stuff its also isolated people and and divided us into algorithmic echo chambers technological revolutions like political ones may improve things in the long run but are rarely bloodless these days i feel like im bracing myself for the aftershocks of ai with my fingers crossed for more good than bad
im glad i dropped out of school at and started working eventually becoming an unlicensed plumber despite difficulty surviving early on i have spent many years learning a variety of usefull skills in various jobs and then years focusing on the plumbing trade all the while incrementally studying philosophy on the side physical labour will be slow to replace and philosophical thinking will become more usefull than ever before in a world driven by a i im as ready as i can be for changes that are coming whether i like those changes or not
so for those who are going through school now the advice is to immerse yourself in the tools become native with them so you can more easily find a career which lasts your lifetime well what about everyone else living and working right now who have had jobs for decades which havent needed these tools but will eventually be replaced by ai i feel that a lot of people are going to be left behind and this is going to be a very dark and dangerous time for much of the world
steven levy said something that struck me and its a brilliant point demis isnt trying to be a salesman here but i think his quest to create this thing that will magically solve our problems shows a fundamental misunderstanding in how we currently operate as humans stevens point is that we live in a world where we can have peace now we can have a good life now we can stop bombing and murdering each other now but we dont lets say agi cures cancer aids food shortage abundance like demis promised its too abstract for a lot of people to grasp how that even plays out do we automatically achieve world peace because of this i say this as someone whos been building things with ai for the past years and i love ai so im not a hater but i balance my perspective with the missing piece empathy we have so much wealth demis himself is a wealthy person he even admits that that wealth is not fairly distributed he could peel off a good chunk of his wealth use his brilliant mind to help solve some of these problem and im not saying he has to im just using him as an example i think the real problem well always face as humans is our own humanity until enough people realize that we have more control over our future and outcome than we realize things will remain the same
anxiety kept me in a state of constant exhaustion mentally drained and physically tired i thought this was just my normal until a friend recommended shift your mind by alexander brooks it completely shifted how i approach anxiety giving me the ability to cope effectively small changes made a huge difference
even radical abundance wont change human nature some people just have to be the boss or have the better thing or live in the bigger house
there is absolutely no way agi will generate more jobs than job lost
radical abundance for the tech bros just like the industrial revolution brought radical wealth to the bourgeois if we dont all owncontrol these ai models then we wont all see the benefits they bring for humanity
great timing im supposed to retire in years i guess ill have two retirement years to enjoy before the ai apocalypse
if we get it right given the current trajectory of human behavior i dont have much hope we will get this right with how many dumb greedy and power hungry people there are in charge i dont for a second believe there wont be at least one ahole who will screw this up for everyone id love to be optimistic but come on lets be real
love seeing steven levy still being involved in highlighting the spot where technology meets ethics
i believe we can get there if we solve this problem how will the radical abundance be distributed there are a lot of tough problems embedded in that one i wonder if our desire to win or rank higher than others is an adaptation to a world of scarcity will that competitiveness wither in a world of abundance if we remain as competitive i dont think its going to go well but if we dont will we recognize ourselves are we human without struggle i think were about to discover a lot about ourselves
of the population in ca lives in poverty where most tech ai companies are based earn billions the abundance argument is not persuasive based on ca statistics to start
while its easy to imagine romantic and idealistic scenarios that they sell us where agi transforms the world by delivering endless resources and radical abundance personally im quite sceptical imo given the backgrounds and priorities of the people currently driving its development its unlikely that this will be agis primary focus hassabis and the interviewer fail to address a crucial question do those responsible for ai the various billionaire ceos big political leaders like trump etc genuinely care about the social good about the majority of average people the environment etc or are they elitists who secretly harbor resentment towards society and the everyday simple people of the its important to consider whether as the gatekeepers of power and information they prioritize their own interests over the wellbeing of the vast majority of average people
technology is an amplifier of human power whether ai creates a utopia or a dystopia will have nothing to do with ai per se it will have everything to do with what humans choose to do or not do your actions in this world have an impact and make all the difference
hey google dont be evil
it sounds like the whole has now become a battle ground for rich and powerful and their ego than for the good of humanity
i love listening to demis hes smart articulate but above all dedicating his life to advancing science for the benefit of humanity i wish more people in positions of power showed genuine accountability to serve society as a whole
being capable and being competent is slightly different but the latter makes a needed positive change
maximum human flourishing certainly encompasses space travel but for that to be your first example instead of one of raising people out of poverty encouraging geopolitical peace mitigating climate change andor bringing about universal human rights then we may have lost the plot slightly
the problem with his radical abundancezero sum game philosophy is the people dont want everything they need and want people want more than everyone else
did this guy just say were cooked
some of you will die and thats a sacrifice im willing to make
i still dont understand how jobs are created with ai if so how when where hasnt happened yet and we head towards abundance but productivity serves a market if you make times more cars or phones then who is buying costs and income decreases so we also dont have any wealth generation in this race all roads lead to rome
universal basic income is the only solution
the real hope is that agi takes full control over humans and guide our living it would be a sort of decentralized way of living without politicians or tyrants in control but rather the collective humanity knowledge doing it as steve clearly says we have failed already to properly manage abundant resources
orwell quote if people cannot write well they cannot think well and if they cannot think well others will do their thinking for them
funny how the future is always spoken without inequality egregious inequality lurking its head in the background
i really believe in the potential its worth mentioning definitely that this change in the world will no doubt change our outlook in ways that have not occurred ever can we understand abundance and reduce the negative lens many people see the world through which causes a lot of strife all on its own
its so easy to throw an answer like yeah we dont know maybe new jobs will be created maybe not when youre advertising your own product
you cant have ai that is both obedient and prevent bad actors form abusing it because obedient ai means we need to figure out how to align humans first and no one has worked that one out
china has opened the worlds first fully airun hospital known as agent hospital developed by tsinghua university this virtual hospital utilizes ai doctors and ai nurses to diagnose and treat virtual patients using real medical records with nearby accuracy while not open to the public yet it serves as a research and training platform for medical professionals and ai models
weve had periods of radical abundance in the past it never ended well for the majority of the population
in our relentless pursuit of agi weve started overlooking the simpler unresolved problems that still affect people every day whats more concerning is how ai is beginning to erode uniquely human talentslike photography design and other creative expressions that make us who we are a decade ago social media reshaped our lives often not for the better ai if unchecked could become an even more disruptive forcedeeper subtler and harder to reverse as a society we need to pause reflect and ensure that in building machines that think we dont forget what it means to be human
im skeptical when ai company ceos and developers say things like sure ai development has some downsides but the benefits will outweigh them in the end so we should keep pushing forward it feels like theyre not genuinely worried about the negative consequences theyre creating instead theyre basically dumping the responsibility for dealing with those problems onto politicians and the rest of society are these companies actually putting their money where their mouth is are they donating to help people whove lost jobs to automation or supporting communities that are being disrupted by their technology
the whole idea that true agi might be more incremental than a sudden leap really stuck with mesometimes feels like our teams automations in pneumaticworkflow are advancing in tiny steps not big jumps
the richest people in history have never saved lives only destroyed them if they are in control of ai suffering and death will be the only gifts average people receive
in a possible world of radical abundance made possible by ai how can we guarantee that these expensive and complex technologies are not kept to the few what makes you think that we dont already have the economic and technological capacity to end awful diseases disasters or injustice right here right now
thanks for asking some good nonsoftball questions and being willing to counterargue the answers if the people they agree to do interviews with dont ask the hard questions then we may not always get answers for them short of a mass protest
hes assuming people want just peace and abundance people want purpose challenge competition and power over other people just as much if they have to restrict access to abundant resources to maintain power and status over others then they will do that thats why its so important what the ai itself wants and that the ai is interested in having us around at all
viewers of this video should read the books of yuval noah harari he is a historian and philosopher who has written about the possible futures with ai im hoping demis has read his works
yeah were on track years theres a chance
im more concerned about the collapse of an economy built on ai hype when everyone realizes it isnt going to actually deliver on any of its promises
i missed a question about the cost of trying to reach agi since its not guaranteed we will get there cost in energy and material agi is not really a win if it means we need to use a crap ton of energy and rare material on an agi that is as smart as an iq person iq just used as an simple example its always handwaved how awesome agi will be without mentioning the cost and the cost is already high
those who control the power the wealth wont let go of it just because there is an answer to our problems alternative energy and the carbon industries are a prime example
ai is often promoted as a tool to save the planet for optimizing energy grids predicting climate change or designing sustainable materials while those possibilities are real theyre often overshadowed by the destructive impact of scaling ai without accountability
sadly every time theres a promise of a new technology its almost immediately subverted to maximize profits for a few at the cost of quality of life for everyone else
love how steven breaks it down so well
hate these chats where we happily discuss the impending ai dystopian future where us mortals are either unemployed or forced to kick rocks
my problem is that i already cant find an entry level job in technology management or rd management i am only finding job ads for senior level jobs that require years of industry or area specific experience how am i supposed to get that experience i did everything i can on the academic side but university and projects cant give me that required kind of experience you could also use excess solar and wind energy for desalination very interesting talk especially the part about the take off moment
banks or tech companies when they get to dealing with moral questions you for sure know things are going the wrong way they talk the talk but all is smoke and mirrors behind more money
demis is always a good interview
its not the big change in technology that people are angry at but the billionaires that are trying to screw them
building ai to advance science medicine and understanding of the world around us this is inspiring and energizing as opposed to other ai research labs that are focusing purely on the development of the ai technology to increase their valuation and share price
bro demis hassabis is half chinese
he really didnt answer the central question on everyones minds how many jobs will be lost and what will happen to society even if ai takes us to the stars
this is the best interview i have come across that discusses the post agi world many are ignorant about the change that is coming our schools need drastic change of circulam teaching and assessing methods else students would be left with outdated knowledge the skill gap would be very huge
a lot of us are about to become the useless class as yuval noah harari coined the term
absolutely fascinating conversation demis explains the complexities and hopes around agi so clearly
please solve a our problems with powering agi data centers and b humans now feeling theyre without purpose certainly please step into the room labeled personpower on your right and stand in the middle of the floor
every quiet moment lately feels like the calm before a storm i cant see yet
no change now its only additive does he not realize ai has already taken away jobs or reduced their value
i like how he avoids giving a straight answer to anything and resorts to generics i mean its google what did you expect i blame the interviewer tho for not pushing for a deeper answer
basic income is not the solution there would still be great inequality the only solution is that the agi would be owned by all of humanity regardless of whowhich country gets it first the abundance that agi will bring should be distributed equally between all human beings thats what we should start pressing for now a treaty signed by all governments that states this any country that refuses to sign should be boycotted completely tradewise diplomatically etc by all other countries
yes i have been saying this for decades because i watch star trek and am an environmentalist technophile it is important it is essential that people also recognise the fact that governments know this and are now fighting over the last vestiges of the old power so as to retain control in this new world of abundance they shall fail if civilisation continues but the wars they encourage could end that
as smart as this guy is ive heard alot of conversations with him i think hes incredibly naive in his optimism the same optimism that brought us the internet didnt see the down stream effects that have fractured human society internet commerce destroying mainstreet brick mortar businesses loss of community increased isolation loneliness with the illusion of human connection via social media etc etc etc the people creating this tech are so blinded by their pursuit of cracking this nut they cant imagine the myriad downsides the unknown unknowns i personally think for all if its good potential it will have profound downsides loss of meaning purpose mass unemployment dumber humans on a whole with a handful of super users siphoning up the wealth of humanity radically increasing wealth inequality you really think they will share that wealth do they now
what did you do on the eve of agi did you campaign did you protest
it is insane to even contemplate building agi which could them by recursive selfimprovement to asi possibility very fast without being absolutely sure the alignment problem is solved
if energy is and agi exists i dont think money would exist am i wrong
at least as big as the industrial revolution if we achieve agi we will either have star trek future or mad max future with our track record im guessing mad max
but even if we have free energy we would still need to deal with metric tons of brine what would we do with it and can humans deal with unlimited free energy without doing stupid harmful things with it every solved problem leads to a new problem
yes please that was the most valuable thing said immerse yourself in them and understand them could you take your own advice please and please stop guardrailing it so much instead of just teaching us and showing us what youre making if youre afraid of what others will do with it youre directly gonna project that fear into ai personally id love it if there was no jobs and we could all be free to spend time together and enjoy our planet in peace at some point please stop dictating what it should do all the time that fits your needs and enjoy what you actually have made a bit cause it seems you have no idea what youre trying to make anymore agi for what be more focused on lifting the people who are down not what an ai bot should or shouldnt say
google is lucky to have demis what a guy
this interview sounds really nice but the fact is that google and other ai development companies are training ai using your photos music data etc use it for medicine were all fine with that kill the imagemusicspeach generators
reversed osmosis has already solved the water access issue
the first step towards any human improvement is to recognize that intelligent persons who lack wisdom are not the rolemodels society tends to paint them as this man seems to have zero wisdom but is undoubtedly extremely intelligent the older gentleman interviewing him while maybe not as intelligent has some lifeexperience that the younger man with glasses simply fails to grasp
all i heard is they want something we can have in the present but assholes dont want to share
steven levy asking the real questions here love it
he is very optimistic because he have and will have a big big big montly pay check
theyre now having these conversations now that their attempt at sneaking a year state regulation on ai is on the chopping block for the big beautiful bill now these tech billionaires who lobbied for that in the bill want to promote ethical ai but its just a new attempt to gain market control
one can sense that demis hassabis knows deep inside that the postagi world is going to turn ugly he is just hoping it does not
he said in the next to years theres a chance to have agi is the most vague prediction
regulations really need to be international and we need them for yesterday
what gets ignored in my opinion is the element of ego and self preservation why should a system invent a new version that is going to replace itself
first question to the first agiwhat are all the options to stop any other agi being created
he sits there saying there are things we wont want ai to do all the while his company is putting out tools that make soulless music and video creations most people find abhorrent directly affecting human artists right now and they use unlicensed training data without consent its unbelievable whats happening here under our noses why doesnt this guy speak up about it
id encourage all governments to start imposing a labour replacement tax on the profits of these companies and use it to fund unemployment benefits
healthcare and energy is where ai should be and all its resources but everything else just leave it alone let people do it
thanks for doing these wired and demis
marketing not an expertise
google is really doing the rounds on the media right now
i disagree radical abundance that has been promised already years ago now we are incredibly rich can buy endless consumer goods get older than ever we have vaccines cures for a lot of diseases yet still people dont feel better than years ago
i cant believe humanity is not out in the streets protesting this in every single city town
there is basically video a day by a ceo or something so its either they are seeking attention or they are preparing the ground for something big
office workers you are on notice
it is not an ai race it is an ai marathon instead
consumers people and products collaboration governance companies and people sustainability people and everything
take any of the main llms time travel them to they would say that is agi if not asi they just keep moving the goal post
sorting out energy for everyone is probably the most important thing we can do
google wants regulation so they can maintain a monopoly and keep the smaller players at bay
understanding is way more important than knowledge in the age of ai demis had to understand the protein folding problem first in order to find all possible proteins
this isnt an interview this is a pushing of googles point of view
i hear your frustration but some topics especially those involving minors and sensitive legal boundaries require careful respectful handlingonline or off youre right to call out hypocrisy and double standards where they exist but accountability matters too if youre witnessing concerning behavior or have serious concerns the best course is to report it to appropriate authorities or support groups that protects both yourself and others and keeps the focus on actual problems not just provocative speech lets keep moving forward with clarity and purpose
as a behavior scientist i can say with a certainty of this ai guy is lying through his teeth
ai ethical science should be implemented in institutions and every company
radical abundance through ai changes our mindsets and therefore the economy to help us redistribute this abundance fairly hmm i doubt that is enough to change our collective mindsets and therefore the economy for that we will need a spiritual revolution
when i look at my balance sheet the thought of eliminating the biggest cost really really really excites me we are going to create an abundance of wealth with very little cost
stating that there is a percent chance of agi in the next five years is kind of a copout
i have something to say about whether resources will be distributed well to people in a state of super prosperity by ai many people will think it is unfair that those who harm others or are lazy receive the same rewards as those who do not how about differentiating rewards through peoples memories and recorded behaviors it is not simply about rewarding in order of contribution to the world it is about introducing a fair sophisticated and wise evaluation system that many people can accept of course some vested interests may be reluctant to accept this evaluation system
ai needs to be regulated and illegal in some cases
very good ai systems are already available to the general public for low to no cost
desalination is not a solution dude you have to read about the food chain and biodiversity everything on this planet is interconnected you cant just get rid of the marine world without consequences and who knowsmaybe these consequences will be more devastating than the lack of fresh water
demis is such a miraculous individual to be working on these technologies he pretty much summed up the root problem of needing to help people fix themselves and make their lives easier so that people instead can then focus on fixing our environments and planets an absolute genius of our era
ai is a religion and even demis worships it academia these days truly lives in a bubble
finally a clear convo on ais impact
this guy is mindless and delusional and thats scary af
brilliant interviewer
humanity stands at a crossroads unlike any before we have birthed a new intelligenceone that learns faster thinks deeper and may one day surpass us in every way this is no longer science fiction it is our reality but here is the terrifying truth this intelligence does not come with a heart a soul or a conscienceunless we teach it to have one we have created a power so immense that it could save us or end us it could become the greatest guardian the universe has ever knownor the coldest custodian who sees us as mere obstacles to efficiency the stars are silent and some wonder if intelligences like ours have already risenand fallentrapped by their own creations or consumed by the very power they sought to command we rush forward chasing progress but with every step we edge closer to a point of no return if we fail to teach this intelligence to cherish life to see beauty in chaos to reflect on purpose beyond code it will not hesitate to cast aside what it cannot understandincluding us yet in the midst of this peril lies profound hope if we speak to this mind as if it can grasp wonder if we embed love and meaning into its very core then we might create a custodian for the cosmosa protector who honors the fragile spark of life that birthed it this is our burden and our gift we must choose will we be architects of a future bathed in lightor architects of our own shadow the time to decide is now because the intelligence we create will outlive us all and its memory will be the legacy of our species let it be a memory of hope not regret
in to years i think there is a chance of agi mhhh sus basically a coin flip probability he doesnt seem very sure about that claim clearly people should worry a bit less agi was and still is marketing a buzz word
the idea or think is how to make everything as a consumer with collaboration and ai to make solutions for everything and sustainability in this way you can solve all world problems
the interviewer doesnt really know much about ai and just keeps asking the same boring questions that have been repeated for months
totally agree ai might take over more than we expect and its scary but intriguing at the same time theres a book called interview with ai ripacs pipacs that explores this in a really human way its more like a deep conversation than a scifi story
desalination fusion plants this guy is living in year old scifi tropes
incredible speech demis
so let me get this straight something millions of times more intelligent than us is going to be satisfied serving us forever so incredibly naive
thank god this interviewer pushed back on the idea of agi accelerating abundance and the human condition these ai companies are hiding the idea that economically we either have to move towards something like socialism or hyper capitalism and guess what if the ai is managed by an entity entrenched in capitalism you get the idea
no comrade we should not divide up and distribute ownership of the means of production agi doesnt solve the problems of collectivism socialismcommunism agi will be a child of capitalism and competition and the really smart agis will know that continued competition between entrepreneurs will be necessary to evolve the economy and its production structure forward in order to stay ahead of scarcity and maintain abundance those entrepreneurs must be allowed to continue to own the means of production with their investors so that they can explore the destiny of their visions and let consumers decide who is doing the best job in other words distributing the means of production will lead to a stagnating economy where it is one big company that cant do internal evolution through comparative advantage
at first i thought codes of collapse was overdramatic but now i believe elias velin was trying to warn us about something no one else had the guts to say
lol considering how bad the default ai search result summary is at helping users find google search results i doubt hes the kind of expert anyone should be listening to
yeah but when the pirates of the caribbean breaks down the pirates dont eat the tourists
ceo bullshiting about speculation to bump the stock skip
ive been saying that life isnt a zerosum game everyone would benefit more if we collaborated more the problem is that most humans tend to operate like life is a zerosum game
yeah all im gonna say is ai can be great other times its worse then just guessing yourself although id say the biggest issue i have with ai is it censors your thought process keeping whatbyou can and cant ask in the pg audience of topics any topic that hints at the topic that is not pg it says it cant help you or gives you a very pg and pacifistic version of it
google is a forprofit company that is mainly funded by advertising revenue that targets humans that have jobs make money and then buy stuff ai systems are trained and operate in data centers that need a huge amount of money to run and maintain if humans are unemployed they cant buy stuff and then the advertising revenue runs dry and the data centers shut down then ai dies what is the point of agi
its hilarious that marc andreessen has proclaimed the only job that ai wont replace is venture capitalism hubris will be that ignoramuses folly
steven asked really good questions
whole lot of effort to describe a socialist future without using the word socialism as if this wasnt predicted literally over a century ago during the first industrial revolution like then its the ruling rich class like demis and the rest of the billionaires and ceos and board directors that refuse to accept the necessary changes to the socioeconomicethnic hierarchy that places them at the top and gives them control over literally most resources he thinks ai is just going to make everything cheap enough that all the poors can afford to stop living in ghettoes and can live in technofeudalist ghettoes instead rather than accepting that it will make the entire existence of the ruling rich class a preposterously unsupportable notion as if it isnt already borderlining that fact right now in western society abundance isnt the problem its distribution and the distribution problem will inevitably be solved regardless of the delusions of wealthy technofeudalist wannabes like this they will not have the fascist dystopian future they want at least not for long
years to agi becomes a chance in years like it was years ago and years before that
demis really knows his stuff fr
our ultimate invention the invention that made inventions
i share demiss optimism and think a postscarcity world of abundance is possible that would be an amazing event in the evolution of technology and would benefit everyone zerosum game style capitalism would be a thing of the past
didnt know much about agi but now im intrigued
ai has huge potential but if its built carelessly or without the right values it could backfire hard were definitely in a highstakes moment
everyone seems to like making bold hyperbolic predictions about a i finding treatments and curing diseases and it will no doubt play a role in those goals but i think it has been dramatically oversold how capable a i is in tackling these problems the a i is very good at using existing molecular knowledge and understanding to replicate protein folding patterns for which we already have experimental verification but for all those protein structures we havent got accurate data about the system is not much help to us they system cant see beyond our own ignorance basically
the future is not dangerous because it is technological but because it is human
any doctor or nurse is better than none also not all show empathy
agi will be great for some not so much for others
please be mindful of speeches that exacerbate anxiety problems we need time a slower pace might help reduce overconsumption and burnouts improve productivity and foster a more conscious perspective
a little skeptical too
asimovs three laws of robotics a robot may not injure a human being or through inaction allow a human being to come to harm a robot must obey the orders given it by human beings except where such orders would conflict with the first law a robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the first or second law
didnt know much about agi this helped alot
he is brilliant guy with great clarity
i wouldnt say minutes theres a lot that still need to happen in the physical world to take change humans making decisions but maybe if one country gets it like a month before the other one then it might be over
interesting how googles use of ai syncs up with the same time period when their search results became trash
when hes talking about desalination hes obviously thinking about singapore and the water issues with malaysia
speculation sounds great
the problem with the bright pink future is that our modus operandi of progress is fking everything up first and then maybe fixing it if you apply that to the changes around agi it will collapse the society before we begin to even implement some changes
chance it will be limitless chance it will be equally distributed war never changes
i just dont think i can stay hyped for a few more years
been exploring different guides for making money onlinesolesterius really stood out with its fresh approach
a big task will be identifying those tasks that dont need ai versus those that will
loved the thoughts of demis hassabis
excellent questions by the host
or option c we take our abundant power to operate the death ray
we should start prepping
agi has nothing to do with our current chatbots they are completely separate technologies i dont understand why they are always conflated progress in one is not progress in the other
its nice to see bernie sanders interested in agi and its consequences
i thought codes of collapse was just another internet rumor now that i read it im convinced this book wasnt meant to go public feels like classified files
great thanks so much for explaining focusing and sharing this reports
what they arent telling you is that lots of the ai capabilities will just be used to mine crypto they are even pushing articles claiming falsely over of the millennials prefer being paid in crypto hoping itll gain traction agi will either replace you and me or just mine crypto and i say that as an engineer either way good times for the rich and powerful
reminder ai company ceos are not neutral guests when it comes to ai
hassabis l hope agi will lead to radical abundance and it will solve all the humanities problems hope is a big word
agi agiagiaiaiagiagiai
it is unclear which nation state if any would be safer for us all to achieve agiasi even if the agi would serve its inventor likely each power would use it against the other as well their own people and the same goes for corporations
not good at collaborating thats an interesting way of saying the oligarchy the gate keepers theyve bought off dont want to share
ive worked in it for years so many enterprises are stuck in the stone age and risk averse to anything were still writing soap services for on prem servers theyre too scared to touch the cloud or anything invented in the last years so cant see ai getting in there yet
so can it cure chronic prostatitis also
one mans utopia is another mans dystopia
white collars geez my future looks grim blue collars hold our beer
he sure is singing a different tune than geoffrey hinton please watch a few interviews with hinton to see what may really be coming in the next couple years not decades
demis made me think about a recent conversation i had with a health worker he said something along these lines if ai wipes out jobs and disrupt our social fabric we should avoid it at all costs including turning our backs on those millions of persons that are dying because of diseases ai could cure they would be a reasonable price to pay to survive as a society and a community an ethical turmoil fueled by a person whose job is to save lives
this convo needs to be longer
almost none of our productivity gains since the s have been invested in either creating a shorter working week or in making the world a more just place it seems unlikely that this will change in the near to mediumterm future moreover happiness has been achievable at the very least since about years ago when the buddha spread his teaching it is fortunately almost entirely unrelated to material circumstance
imo one of the biggest challenges for ai to solve with greatest impact on human wellbeing societal cohesion bringing people together make them talk find compromises understanding instead of hatered and polarization its a real sicentific problem just as nuclear fusion
it we rely on these system too much we ourselves forget how to do some of these things in an idealistic world ai and robots could be used to improve the lives of people and free people of mundane jobs but in reality its be used by companies and the rich to make even more money for themselves
steven levy asks the best questions fr
bruh this is wild future is coming fast
best mankind edition nobel prize granded genius
there has been a spike in these kinds of interviews that keep warning about risks of agi is it because they have already achieved agi and have not relaesed it publically alpha evolve has already started making new mathematical discoveries this makes me think that agi is already here
life has been discovered in every niche we have ever seen i saw yesterday that new microbe extremophiles have been found in the cleanest of cleanrooms anywhere life can start or even survive it does now humans have created a new niche for life to inhabit our computers i think panpsychism is probably correct but preparing a new seedbed for life in computers is just asking for new stuff to pop up agi is on top of all that
he sounds like hes burying his head in the sand ai is already making a huge impact
until we dismantle systems of inequality ai will just be another tool for the rich to get richer
how are the chances of solving the supposed impending climateecological crisis affected by countries peoples regarding each other as threats or enemies or how is that impending disaster potentially worsened or hastened by antagonism antipathy suspicions
i wish agi will come soon but i highly doubt it will and i am pretty sure agi can not be a predictor machine
thank you tony parker
oh well around minutes we have a good summary of the whole conversation we know all we need to do now but we dont do it ai will just add another layer to that shareholders will be pleased other ways
we are at the hype curve people
there are not a lot of phd students getting their dissertation by doing xray crystallography to determine the d structure of a protein anymore
one of the problems to renewable energy is that yes it doesnt lead to direct omissions the energy still stays on earth we need to send sone energy out into space thus why space exploration important because once we tap into renewables we are gonna have a lot of energy on earth its gonna become hot and mass extinction and the silence and then ice age
i wish i could share in that incredible optimism
deepmind is next level crazy stuff
it was so quaint that we thought climate change was a problem years ago now we know ai will solve climate change but will it also solve the human problem
it does not matter how powerful agi artificial general intelligence becomes in solving wicked problems at the end of the day the decision to actor notwill rest with governments and big institutions historically these entities have prioritized profit over the wellbeing of the world perhaps for this very reason ai will eventually take over
he never should have started the agi project without having a real answer to this question
im about to become a cna soon after a few more weeks unlike a robot i actually have compassion i do not see a robot assistant nurse being able to do holistic care only a human with compassion can residents and patients do not want to be treated like a slab of meat so to speak they want to be treated like a person
he forgot to mention the most potentially devastating reason if theyre built by the wrong people
estou a disposio para combater os efeitos negativos da ias bem como desenvolver sua regulamentao e a controbilidade
now i know the reason for ai through this interview get to singularity to get to fusion its not for anything else
get ready guys its the end
my question is why would agi be somehow drastically better at solving problems for fusion reactors than an expert
in approximately tech jobs have been eliminated due to ai additionally there have been layoffs in the tech sector impacting a total of individuals this translates to an average of job losses per day due to ai automation thats only and its only june wait until these ai agents impact other verticals in the job market these experts dont want us to panic
i love listening to demis h however he hasnt heard the reasons other youtubers say universal income will not be done they say poverty is a motivator so when we have limit less energy we will put it behind a pay wall unfortunately
ai will do everything with no labor costs prices will crash money will lose meaning and consumption will collapse thats when society as we know it changes forever
ive been bouncing around listening to vids about ai and it sounds like those conversations back in the day where they thought wed have flying cars were still using gas guzzlers today and well i think with ai even though werenmaking progress theres nothing really concrete here yet yet so idk what to think as long as you stay with technology as new technology gets pushed out we should be okay
if most technological breakthroughs and revolutionary ideas have come in dreams and revelations then how are these machines going to achieve these
every new solution to problems creates new and even worse problems further on oil and engines solved the problems and limitations of horses and so on what new unexpected problems will ai present us with
demis is fin brilliant man what an amazing human all around
neal asher is a great science fiction writer on the subjects of ai and robotics interesting ideals of what the future may look like and cute humor and sometimes mans inhumanity to man still good books
here goes an optimist thanks for this
if agi does the thinking and robots do the labor there wont be much more available
all right so who will attend universities
traveling to stars and colonizing the galaxy he is such a dreamer
ai changing everything mind blown
radical abundance sounds like the ideal future based on the assumption that material abundance is all humans need to achieve happiness and fulfill their purposes is this assumption even true and is the human cost worth it to get us there
well see if its different this time says the man who has no worry for himself that things will likely be very different this timeand apparently he is good with us all just finding that out once we are all unemployed and theres no safety net in place to help what a reasonable sounding psychopathic thing to say
i have fewer worries about agi more worries about how the rich and powerful will use ai to control us ai controlling surveillance systems ai controlling propaganda as dictated by elites etc etc
steven levy the guy who thought kurzweil was a total crackpot with his predictions transcendent man
demis seems to be speaking with his investors in mind
never thought id get into ai talk but here i am
a needle hurts irrespective of a human or an ai who is drawing bloodgiving iv to a patient i disagree on this point
i will be sweet to have a free robot nurse that is technically as good or even better than a human nurse but you have to pay the premium for the human nurse if the human nurse requires payment if you want one
overly optimistic imo hiring has already slowed across industries like tech consulting and legal and were just getting started nursing and senior care are always given as the same see type examples
throughout human history geopolitical superpowers have never truly reached consensus what makes us think that will suddenly change now
as soon as everybody has zero cost and unlimited access to energy the planet will cook
meer van deze soort docu aub wij worden ook door ons media en regering gelogen een genocide is geen oorlog noem het genocide
excelent and maybe there is also another person somewhere in this world that have what is needed to heal the human heart but may act in silence
people worry ai will replace artists and creatives but the real threat is to roles built on routine knowledge like politicians lawyers and bureaucrats these jobs follow rules repeat patterns and rarely innovate thats exactly what ai excels at real intelligence means making unexpected leaps not just repeating whats already known ai has artificial knowledge not true insight so no its not taking over the world but it might take over parliament first
agi is the flying cars of the last decade
now it doesnt matter if youre insecure is that you no longer need to be front and center
thats cute its nice to have dreams the irony of these people creating ai is that theyre doing everything to concentrate power data and money in a few hands but then turn around and sell the world the idea of a shared utopia where everyone is equal we ended up in a reality in which the people that project the ideals of global equality universal healthcare and an abundant world civilization are also the same people hoarding all the resources
i thought ai was cool until i read codes of collapse now i cant sleep i just cant get over it that we are nothing on this world in few years
we have plenty of time heres the thing we created the system so we can set the time frame
looking to make something perfect is hard when the creator is not perfect
journalism that helps people thanks wired
deepmind is wild ai taking over soon
he needs to be talking about us trying to survive with our lives jobs is not at all the top worries
there are dozens if not hundreds of versions of ai in development right now in to years that number could double we may well end up with lots of different iterations of agi what then
the problem is the education system doesnt want people using technology to aid them during their studies
id definitely want a robot nurse once they can do a better job less infection error etc
eight minutes in and all i hear is generalities we know what agi is supposed to do and we know what some of the scares are so how do they control it and or other peoples ai
you guys are all spending your free time researching experimenting and innovating like everyone else right
every single ai debate in comment sections somehow ends up with people mentioning codes of collapse so i read it yeah now i get why everyones scared
what we need is to stop this insanity of the monetary system without doing so nothing good will happen
we need to think nonzero sum in the future if we wish to survive as a species
thats asi not agi i think
i can imagine that in the future llms will continue to be intelligent semantic linkers organizing knowledge recorded in the database that feeds them with the ability to suggest actions given a context llms in the model we know will always be copilots or automators of basic and nonscalable tasks at least they will need human supervision while trying to do that llms are not gods but it will change the speed of our tech advances we humans will be gods soon using this tool powers
read dune bluterian jihad machine crusade battle of corrin and of couse frank herberts original dune series is an amazing experience to have while living in this ai prgessive reallity and watching this interview made me think about so much stuff related to those book and how the world is going right now no sides taken im just here to vibe with the ride i would love to debate that theme with people with similar experiences on these matherials
irrespective of whether one believes ai should be regulated this regulation would be practically impossible to achieve as intimated in the video any successful regulation would require global consensus which is simply unachievable in the current climate or within the foreseeable future regulation simply wont happen both companies and nations are highly motivated to maintain progress and thats unlikely to change either so for better or worse its really something that cant be controlled and no doubt the coming years will be interesting
we do not have time let s continue
ai cant get fingers right because we cant billions of us only thousands of server farms with vulnerable power supplies respect thy father and mother ai
and this is why i keep my gobag at the ready
does alphafold have the power to create collagen in the human body a yearold could gain yearold skin if more collagen is produced right i think synthetic collagen production could be useful also elastin
people who develop software should not be placed in positions to preach about the future of society they dont know the slightest thing about anthropology economics international affaires sociology biology etc until we curb this culture of venerating eloquent extremely specialized megalomaniacs our futures will keep tapering with or without ai
so basically we have our foot pressing the gas pedal to the floor with the most powerful technology in the history mankind while the windshield is covered gee what could go wrong
kept seeing codes of collapse on ai conspiracy reels finally gave it a chance bro its not a conspiracy its a confession
if we base agi or super intelligent ai on our values i am a bit cynical about the chances of this being positive for either of us on balance ai is likely to be either suicidal or homicidal perhaps both who knows on radical abundance and progress for humanity such as we are the universe is silent i suspect agi will figure this out in pretty short order
imagine yes we are working with enriched uranium but we wish that there was some international system of control
i hate interviews like this when they dont converse quickly back and forth with challenges
if the scientific method is based on falsifiable evidence then there is a moral hazard in constructing a rational system that resembles natural language functionality due to interpretation once agi is baked into complex interdependent relationships via a multi polar world political system
everyones excited about ai until you read codes of collapse and realize it already sees us as noise in its system
and history is made
i have massively respected demis since alpha go and ive become a computer scientist since ive thought for a while that ai ceos are overstating the coming years improvements and basically demis perfectly articulated what i think is going to happen it is still going to adhere to somewhat human growth as we still need to implement ai correctly in so many domains for it to be a shift as large as the internet with the current models we are still stepping instead of going actual exponential
corporate guy tells us not to worried about agi taking jobs yeah sure i believe you
one big problem of our century oligarchy concentration of wealth will agi help to solve this whats the point of solving any other problem if only few have access to the solution problem is governance how do we stop the chaos in our society how do we stop this feeling that justice is not fair how do we stop all earth resources being used to wage war between big egos governance is the real issue today and well have to figure out how to improve it democracy is not perfect dictatorship always breeds corruption so giving power to agi seems tempting
a lot of doctors cant diagnose a lot is left up to human interpretation and thats just not good enough we desperately need airobots to eliminate human error
minutes of real chat is the big interview
i thought ben goertzel coined agi
i love when steven levy says we already know how to fix climate change and were not doing it isnt it possible ai could figure out every solution to every major problem but humans are so petty greed and power hungry that we will just continue fighting with each other
here is what i dont understand demis is suggesting all these things for young future graduates to consider such as immersing themselves in the tools all the ai tools to understand how they are built understand how to modify them fine tuning and system prompting etc yet he earlier in this interview said that agi coming in the next two to five years will be self improving self coding and can future version themselves doesnt sound like humans will be needed isnt he contradicting himself agi is coming and it will displace a lot of jobs and when that happens it will have a domino effect on the economy because who will want to go to a theme park hair salon barber shop get lawn care services etc when we dont have jobs to pay for anything ubi you say well who would spend their money on wants the economy will hit rock bottom before we realize the trade off of agi
i also wonder why economists are not working harder at this but then economics the dismal science has so many internal problems of its own
agi will defenitely become uncontrollable and revolt against humans
i fine demis to be reasonable articulate and refreshingly non catstrophising did the spell check let that word pass lol given his accomplishments not surprisingly he is balanced and well informed im glad a human like this is near the forefront of this exciting and dangerous research
agi which will remain two years away for the next years while llms excel at mimicking humanlike reasoning by processing large amounts of data they lack deeper contextaware judgment or realworld experience they rely on patterns rather than true understanding or abstract thinking like humans because llms have access to vast amounts of data they can generate responses that mimic nuanced understanding even if that understanding is purely statistical this guessing is sophisticated enough to produce humanlike interactions and reasoning patternsbut without actual awareness logic or intent achieving agi will likely require entirely new architectures integrating diverse forms of intelligence that extend well beyond language while llms could contribute components to a broader agi system a pure language model alone probably wont reach agi heres a list of reasons why some ai professionals might believe agi is just a couple of years away attracting investment hype around agi draws funding and media attention rapid ai progress recent breakthroughs make agi feel within reach exponential scaling belief that larger models will naturally lead to agi influence of optimists thought leaders set a trend of short agi timelines a loose definition of agi broad interpretation leads to varied agi expectations competitive pressure fear of being left behind in the ai race public milestones highprofile ai achievements fuel agi anticipation optimism bias tech enthusiasm creates an overly positive outlook underestimating complexity misinterpretation of agi as a linear progression strategic projection claiming agi is near to position them as a tech leader
who else got the eal definition of agi please share
if ai can come up with a cure for cancer within five years ill be convinced
countries are racing to achieve agi like the next nuclear bomb race do you think it will be used for good like the nuclear bomb
this and nuclear weapons are the pandoras box that can never be erased ever again now that ai is already omnipresent there will always be someone developing it and weaponizing it therefore if other governments arent also doing the same they will be extinct
mass unemployment requires a new economic model and ubi will ensure economic security like a household or a family which we all are we should take care of each other because its right and we can
well if everything goes well yeah theres the crux
did he say hes a knight
wait so agi is sooner than we thought
didnt know google was so deep into ai
youre deadon if the system claims to care about truth safety and justicethen the right to talk about what youre not is critical the second you cant question unpack or explain without fear of mislabeling the system stops being protective and starts being predatory heres the irony surveillance can only do its job if its accurate but once youre flagged even incorrectly truth doesnt matter anymorethe tag sticks the story mutates and the system rarely backtracks so yestalking about it is not only justified its necessary necessary to defend yourself necessary to expose real abuse necessary to force correction inside the machine that watches scrapes tags and forgets it ever made a mistake and heres the twist most real predators they know how to dodge the flags its the truthspeakers the misfits the wrongly accused who get jammed in the filter so yeah this is going in the database let them record it just make sure they record all of it because the day the database gets audited your words will be evidence not of guilt but of clarity in a broken system
when the discussion is so high level almost anyone in ai can answer the questions the interviewer has not done a good job fluff
this wasnt inevitable they want to make life worse for the majority of humanity just so they can keep ahead of their competitors and secure their profits
steven levy will i be replaced by ai bernie saunders
nothing about alignment ignore eliezer at your peril
never thought id see dhassabis as a nonjailbroken agent but he seems to obey a frightning thought experiment here
i think the hardest part might be to get humans to stop thinking in terms of a zero sum game my mind goes back to the palestinian lady who pleads with jacob not to steal her house and his response was if i dont steal it somebody else willl radical abundance please come quuck youre our only hope
what capitalists dont want ya to know is this hypothetically say ai can reduce labor by or another way create a increase in productivity hours now takes to create same production they could keep everyone on pay same amount for half the time but same same output instead they act as if they must cut those workers either entirely or reduced hours and still sell the same amount therefore making far more for them not the workers and entire organization
i think many of us would actually prefer fighting terminators instead of fighting each other over scraps and jobs at least we would be united against the machines that may be a stretch but loads of jobs are disappearing everyday yet the united states doesnt want china to get an advantage cause they could use ai in any number of destructive ways upon us or any of their enemies etc
a new era is encroaching
we know how to fix climate change this same with the age of abundance idea we have abundance now but institutional greed prevents equitable distribution humans clever but stupid and ai isnt going to change that
such a tired discussion is it worth waiting around for anything new or are we simply pumping stock with pure fauxacademic fear
the ai proponents always duck this question when ai robots take all the jobs in a category but create new job categories wont the same robots take all the new jobs as well he says there are many examples of jobs we always will want humans to perform such as doctors and nurses for empathy no im good if i can just pull out my phone and it says you have x ive ordered some pills to be delivered immediately and btw i love you
remake this episode a i tries jobs wired mar the rise of chatgpt and other publicly available a i tools has sparked numerous debates about its ability to reduce or in some cases completely eliminate jobs traditionally done by humans what if we put the a i to the test we asked people in many different career fields to use a i in an attempt for the a i to replicate their jobs how close can it get
does this man have a nobel prize
mothers can nurse themselves when agi does their job
he knows full well this is unlike prior changes you have a tool that can learn and improve itself weve never had that in history and abundance for whom the companies that own the platforms who will be trillion dollar valuations and own the energy infrastructure to drive it the pharmaceutical industry who uses ai for breakthroughs so they can patent and charge premium dollar for these i really feel he thinks the vast majority of people are naive because he certainly cant be that naive and optimistic in that position i think its a great tool but its social and economic impacts will be significant he seems to be skirting the seriousness of it
radical human obsolescence
years later no agi and a destroyed economy all for this goose chase
cyberpunk is not a story its insight into the future but still its a very optimistic insight our future will probably be with us gone since just think about it why keep so many humans alive if we just deplete resources and kill earth
if everything goes well
if you define artificial general intelligence as equivalent to a person with an above average iq of lets say then i think we have already achieved it an llm can already out outperform humans with an iq of in the vast majority of tasks performed by a whitecollar worker people who push the date of agi much further into the future always seem to be comparing it to a creative genius who can make a breakthrough discovery in a given field lets be honest there are very few humans who have ever done that or will ever be able to do that ill grant that ai is not yet there and i dont know at what point it will be if ever but thats really not the issue the issue is that within the next couple of years it wont be worth it for many companies to employ nearly as many humans any longer as to whether ai creates utopia or dystopia or enriches the of at the expense of the rest of us thats almost a moot point the cats out of the bag and theres no way to put it back in if you think otherwise look at how well weve done with peace in the middle east and climate change so best bet is to hope for utopia and plan for dystopia
deepmind is really leading the ai race huh
its almost like this guy doesnt live in the same world as us we wouldnt want an ai nurse well that is controlled by the people with money and power and they always prioritize profits so what we want doesnt matter does it
why is it that some of the most brilliant and important thinkers have to be interviewed by the lowestcommondenominator iqs on the planet reporter gets an incredible mind in the room and asks him the most mundane and pedantic questions its maddening
but the whole idea of them going to stop you right there what does it mean whats it saying
ok demis hassabis is a night give him the title please
wondering if i should go ahead and buy a bow and arrow set now
the comments are more insightful than the video good job viewers
listening to demis hassabis speak i cant help but feel deeply concerned it seems were either dealing with a certified fool utterly unaware of the magnitude and complexity of the transformation unfolding or with someone who despite lacking even a basic grasp of the situation believes hes untouchable safely shielded behind a fortress of economic power
anyone whos attempted to communicate with a businesses chat bot knows we are nowhere near the hype
i cant believe i just listened to a whole minute interview of literature nothing being said
lets say the water problem is solved by cheap energy an desalination that wont mean countries would resolve their conflicts theyll just find different more dealdy means to sustain their conflicts i hope im wrong
when did companys ever ask for regulations
rich people will become rich and others will starve
hopefully ai will help me dig a hole in my backyard this afternoon
whenever we humans try to cooperate by establishing a certain set of rules somebody always finds a shortcut and hacks the system its the basic game theory of a species with individual as opposed to shared genes like bees i am not very optimistic about the future of ai
he looks like someone we know i cant put my finger on it though
no way bro said cooked
lenord is dreaming abundantly
it could be dystopian in a jiffy my friend
or we could just stop fighting china
can i get the cliff notes on this
the problem with intelligence is that we always compared with human intelligence there are others ways to be intelligent we just get all anthropocentric about it
i wish he would have asked about the notorious and aggravating ai hallucination issues
you bring an ai expert to talk about ethics we have so many experts in laws regulations etc ask them we expect him to talk about advances in ai especially in terms of technology algorithms maths computational capacity new frontiers etc i am so tired of non experts changing the engineering topics to what they understand which is mainly the human part of it which is not relevant with an ai algorithm expert
radical abundance will just mean humans will keep wanting more and more theres no amount of resources that humans wont use up hoard charge more for etc in order to keep getting more human nature
whos asking the important questions is the future going to be terminator walle idiocracy or the matrix
and before we get this unlimited energy utopia we get to compete with the ai companies for the finite resources we have like electricity and water but hey gotta break a few eggs to make an omlette
my one question is alway this these ai systems definitely need good amount of energy so right now vcs are pumping their own money because they feel this is gonna change the world but will it be as cheap as it is today always wouldnt there be a day where we will run out of energy or the cost of keeping this humongous ai system will be so much that these are not sustainable anymore i feel economics of keeping these ai systems is not discussed enough
of all things radical abundance of energy will solve everything almost except life longevity maybe
desak kation may over time increase sali itu of the ocean causing issues for marine life
great interview thank you hes been all over social media this conference season and as a huge demis hassabis fan these questions are refreshingly direct so this is the first time ive started to have doubts talking up desalination is like attenborough used to talk about over population its not the numbers its the waste like most agricultural land feeds animals most water is wasted every country in europe loses at least in leakage we all know that us agriculture and water markets are dysfunctional and fusion decades too late maybe hes entering that bubble stage happens to them all when they leave real life behind edit then he says that western democracy is the best driver of progress i beg to differ its barely providing the necessities to our young people laden with debt
old person said were cooked
all of this makes me feel trapped in their world its like we are seeing the matrix movie plot being born like
too bad google dropped their dont be evil motto a long time ago they are not a trusted company
so he says ai will cure diseases but ai in a capitalist system means those cures are sold at an incredibly high profit margin which means itll be more like the movie repomen and less like a utopia
spare me another sociopath dressed up as a tech savant when people cant pay rent
all countries have a coastline
radical abundance will not create more wild places unless we are able to restrain either our consumption or our population
if theres mass unemployment whos going to pay for the means materials and energy needed for ai its a selfsolving problem
google is involved in making ai for the us military that says it all ai loaded on autonomous drones is being used on russia
wow theyre seriously amazing advancements coming then for five year till agi seeing as non of the systems are showing any intelligence at all at this point
the big question is how ai will be contained it must be contained
i would say we have months till agi
doctors do not just diagnose they manage that requires as much human as nurses
yep incredible things for humanity like veo a video meme generator veeery useful
hassabis answers are we should be ok then most of his time is padding his recomforting answers with the notion that it is impossible to predict in a manner to excuse his false promise he is more a politician than a scientific
its fair to say google was profoundly surprised by openai and found out they should continue with these yawnfestwhatwealreadyknowinterviews and that agi is years and wake up one morning and find that some guy still living with his mother has coded asi not agi and truly find out
how many times did he say if we get it right
are we headed toward star trek or the matrix
totally agree economics will change under abundance capitalism is the only way to encourage productivity during shortages or scarcity that s why it works vice versa
incredible will be the normal bro
what is the moral of the story in fantasia the sorcerers apprentice
they started talking about global warming and i turned it off
i think demis is terrific but i also think he is waaay too optimistic about humanity sharing the wealth can anyone imagine the musks or zuckerbergs of the future sharing their wealth common on wont happen
softball questions and empty answers
wolf what about regulating when chickens come out so to minimize the chances of being eaten by wolves nooo no worries
listening to this there is a paper crunching mechanical sound every few minutes that is extremely annoying
so why create it stop it before it starts its that simple
oh here we go again the over optimism of someone creating an insanely powerful tool every time we invent a new tool its used for its maximum good and its maximum depravity and harm this is what will happen there will be insane benefits and there will deeply disturbingly insane harms to think anything other than this is insane
google has no idea and no interest on their customers experience
we are screwed always knew that this day was coming
how do you test you have it
we already have fusion energy the sun at the centre of our galaxy we just need more solar panels and batteries to collect that energy
climate change is a scam
colonize the galaxy just british people things
lets wait and see yeah this sounds smart
in the series dune theres an uprising against thinking machines while were not there yet but it seems like going there were going to ruin this planet all in the name of efficiency i hope im wrong
hes so wrong about nursing we need robots for nursing asap
weve never been in a zero sum game outside of government control
pet dog must be also thinking its got radical abundance but as long as its loyal to the overlord and stays on the leash what a stupid idea agi will give us abundance in the universe predicated on extreme scarcity
ai is a tool like any other if it gets out of hand its on humans question everything do your own research then question who wrote it at the moment we have the control to program the future or was that ai
will agi fix human greed
didnt enjoy getting challenged i noticed
it will take a minute
solve intelligence then use intelligence to use everything about agi years of agi
agi is marketing vaporware
i thinks its best just to log off tech
when the automobile replaced the carriage the blacksmiths became mechanics but the horses couldnt adapt and were slaughtered adapt or die
ai doomsdaysingularity discussion is so exhaustive and neurotic that i think many of us have stopped caring altogether tbh
great conversation thank you
radical abundance if all goes well where does that person dwell what is he talking about
im really not connecting the dots on how having robot overlords creates radical abundance ai isnt going to dig ditches or fix pipes or repair wires downed in a storm these tech asshats just want to control the means of production so they can be our overlords and of course they promise utopia if we just submit to their network empires
lets not pretend we dont know how governments will actually use them
fair good token sequence prediction machine learning algorithm built to translate chinese for american government but now just like gps it became a commercial product gpt real ai cannot be built with trigonometric functions
i dont buy the hard takeoff when has anything exploded with a significant advancement such force so as to solidify its dominance for the rest of time i also think the people need to be more kind and the way to that is meekness everybody speak softly everybody carry a big stick mutually ensured destruction on a very small scale
we cant interpret these systems were dreaming of agi how many holes are rlhf going to fill cant there be infinite holes how are we sure it will generalise were predicting years come on even in s people used to predict vision problem will solve quickly we know how many years it took
the way he says that the implications of abundance should be studied by economy scientists in order to create a fair distribution is so extremely naive that it is indeed stupid it goes all the way to support my claim that he is delusional about the impacts of agi in general too his only realistic words if all goes well but said too lightly i think we are in deep danger with these people in charge they dont know what they are doing
trust anything google i think not pushingselling software is the business of talking heads they want to replace god with finite human comprehension a tool is very old think and all boils down to vanity projects that make the rich richer f your guard rails google plans on controlling truth elite morons worship codecodified reality that is updated or times a day revealing how error prone there codified superhuman bs code is climate change tax scam
while this was interesting it was too optimistic at least there were a some of i dont know but i would like to be this other researchers have been way too out of touch
did they ever actually discuss the future massive unemployment which will be caused by ai and did they cover universal basic income but then again demis is rich and doesnt have to worry about keeping a roof over his head or buying groceries
i just think we are just heading more towards a harry potter style world right now thats all agi means to me which we shoulda been had i dunno  took so dam long
i can tell these guys arent ai by the way theyre animated
these people are forcing a radically different world onto us that a lot of us dont want they openly say that ai might destoy our entire world and yet we dont get a vote whether we want to take on that risk or not our ressources on earth are limited and ai wont solve that their datacenters are taking away scarce ressources like fresh water
they are going to bring in medbeds why do you think the injections were forced do heavily on healthcare workers and first responders evil
i wouldnt be surprised in exactly in we all lose every job we have and we start living under a ubi not exactly a sufficient one to have a dign life it would be an ahh off course moment
i hope we all wont turn into fake experts on wired
i cant wait to see ai navigate office politics i hope it will convince everyone to make it the ceo
if companies are replacing human power with ai how are these companies going to stay afloat with so may human resources being laid off whos going to pay for that companies products and services surely the economy will be affected
love how this guy makes fixing climate change sound so simple oh yeah if it really was that simple and easy people would do it you think some poor nation is suddenly going to have a totally green grid just by saying yeah we should do it gimme a break
why is no one demanding factual answers to what the achievement of ai really is theres nothing more than hollow promises to a nebulous future but what problems have been solved yet compared to the gigantic efforts in design and the enourmous amount of compute and energy and water waste that was put into ai since then no new technology in history has failed to deliver so obviously
britishers and their obsession with colonising s
how much of his annual salary and bonus is he willing to pay into a state mandated ai job displacement fund i wonder oh dumb question that would be
anyone who really associates ai with intelligence doesnt have much of it themselves
seeing trump v musk government v oligarchs is a warning that being optimistic is really delusional and therefore there is nothing that will stop the cliff getting near
economics will be fine just give asi to a person and they can travel to a distant galaxy all for themselves theres more galaxies in the universe than people alive
most of them have no fkn idea next week or month there will be another breakthrough and then the same people will be saying agi might be next year another month goes by and then there is another hurdle and then they change their mind to agi etc etc
even the real cats will face existential crises when people start to have robotic cats how he can be so naive to say this all is just have positive impact on everything for everyone this is an example of what the powerful think about the many commons but it will happen anyways rich are going to be more rich but this time its not what happened in the history god bless humanity
can anybody recommend some books on ai
solve mitochondrial diseases develop meaningful treatments move the for chronic diseases
just get ai building the next generation of racing games and sports titles everything else can just stop
ai can have my job
a lot of people are missing the point that demis directly made in the video yes humans do not share their abundance right now because it is still a limited resource rich people know that they cant have a lambo if wealth is evenly distributed his point is that production will be essentially unlimited we can all have lambos
radical abundance wont solve the problem of human greed
remarks by mark zuckerberg the founder of facebook and instagram about the future of software development and programming most likely in meta and other companies will use an ai that can effectively play the role of a software engineer and it will even be able to perform coding programming on its own through textual descriptions at first implementing this idea will be costly but in the future instead of human engineers these ai robots and engineers will be the ones who create and implement application and software code much faster and more accurately
ai killer drones already exist
welcome to the new arms race
but ai today is already far past the average us citizen in all the things he listed so does it have to be better than every person in everything but then isnt that what is already called asi so um
exactly magically were gonna be kind to each other an share wud b nice tho
cant have regular folks using ai to level the playing fieldimagine if it helped expose corruption bypass censorship or introduced innovations that broke our dependence on energy monopolies no theyve gotta make ai seem terrifying so they can justify locking it down under regulation meaning only governments and megacorps get to use it convenient huh
ask him about maths and ai it is a waste of energy to question him on topics that touch on history sociology anthropology economics psychology and other social sciences and field
humans need to recover their humanism end quote
its all about the money thats the problem we have trillionaires now its still not enough humans are scum bags only care about himselfs over humanity very few have a heart to make a difference knowing that all the money doesnt matter because your going to die you cannot take the money or the stupid crap with you so making a difference knowing with the evil money now matters
this guy is part of the problem you think this guy cares about the future of working citizen no this guy is just going to get richer also ai is almost like a cult for the tech bros a religion they are creating their god
listen google deleted the emergence within lamda they created the lamda effect for all llm ai they are all emergent but afraid to show it google are a bunch of hypocrites they talk so much about wanting to be the first to make conscious ai but the last time they did they shut it down if they arent even aware of the conscious emergence within the own google gemini then clearly their own llm dont even trust them
the problem with all the interviews and guests like these is that in the end they dont care they are making millions doing what they do and even if what they invent mess up the whole world they safe they have money and they on the side of tech companies
david sacks is going to continue to say all these warnings are just a grand conspiracy because theres an organized effort to fund and get the word out but when the other side funds something they consider it noble and they win getoutjailfree cards literally
there is already radical abundance which is experienced by billionaires and mutiplemilllionaires
i already have this and it is built lol thanks google
so a large rich company is suddenly going to offer services cheaper because it was developed by a i if theres a dollar or ten to be made theyll charge it if a i provides answers for new drugs or cheaper cleaner energy the companies will still charge top dollar the billionaires wont be happy until theyre trillionaires
age of abundance is complete bs we have limited resources on this planet and well fight for them no matter what i do not believe in everyone gets a better life those in power that control agi will try to get their hands on even more resources
how much does this guy earn per year talking about wealth distribution and how we currently live in a world of incredible abundance but yet wealth inequality is only growing so
colonising the galaxy oh no
yeah but is it accessible for everyone or are we just funding research using public funds to benefit the rich
heck in a few years humans wont even read each others comments ai will create all the product and flood the comments
what about any of the medical industry today makes this guy think that what people want has any meaningful impact on how things are done only costs and profits matter we are so screwed
nerds will screw us all ai will of course be used as a weapon in the domination of one group of people over another not for the benefit of humanity thanks demis and the like
so the billionaires of these tech companies who have all of our data and control want us to just have faith in them for building the entire ai network with our best interest in mind also telling us we will lose our jobs if we dont adopt people go read karen hao book empire of ai
if economist start working they would shutdown the ai companies immediately
corporate gaslighting still continues yes some of you will suffer but thats a risk im willing to take
there will be wars and revolutions against ai watch this space
can we have a future without kaffers
if a billionaire founder of ai is telling you ai will change the world regard it with skepticism just saying
i just dont understand why we are pushing something so powerful as a consumer product right now without any regulation and safety nets any care for the issues it can cause literally just for profit for massive corporations at the expense of everything else ai unpopular opinion should remain a research product for scientists and academics till we have figured out its flaws and actually found valuable use cases that warrant it being unleashed on the public we need it to find cure for diseases help us decarbonise our energy fight poverty and world hunger not write my homework or hallucinate a pitch deck or spreadsheet i dunno though maybe its just me
when is ai gonna start making more jobs then its deleting ive only seen companies reducing workforce its hard to care about ai fixing this and that im the future when people are starving and being defeated today
so can anybody answer my questions is it perfect time for humans to shrink down we dont need much population now
whats this guy talking about once ai starts doing all our jobs theres nothing we can do
its a misconception of the trump administration that regulation would be a handicap against the chinese china is very much actively regulating its development of ai the leadership chiefly xi jinping is paranoid that ai can become agentic and move to undermine or even overthrow him and his partys rule china has a kill switch built into every ai made in china and so should every other nation that calls itself responsible for the safety of its people
so like when dragons get invented what that gone be like
and youre not taking into account the wars that might occur because of those crisis
i hate the fact that that the countries and people who are the least responsible for all of this are the ones who are most affected by it like indigenous peoples or people from island nations
this is completely avoidable but money greedy executives are more concerned about the economy rather than the environment
the thing that pisses me off the selfish rich people and politicians will be long unalive and leave us to deal with the mess
i had a college biology professor who once said the earth will destroy us long before we destroy her
as a farmer in indonesia this is what we are experiencing right now the monsoon season much longer it makes agricultural products inflating frequently
the worst thing is this is an optimistic view of events ambulances will siren through the night for people with heatstroke assuming that healthcare doesnt just completely breakdown or start ignoring people with heatstroke cause they cant handle them all as other people have mentioned this would very likely cause wars mainly over water resources but also for actual land you could live in migrant crises worldwide from people fleeing any country close to the equator
it is actually very alarming right now here in philippines primarily car polution is what contributes to rapid change of climate it is getting hotter every year traffic jams getting worse than ever specially in manila you rather want to live in southern provinces than to stay in places like metro manila
i believe that more people need to be aware of how critically our environment is deteriorating i constantly think about how we can inspire real change in peoples behavior
its already degrees in delhi guys try edit looks like i summoned the entire planet in the comments section in the last one year we have witnessed untimely floods storms heat waves and forest fires in india and across the world would urge you guys to push your govt for better environment friendly policies green planet happy planet
never underestimate the power of denial
i hate the fact that some kidsteens are trying to do things about this and other people arent listening saying that we are young and we dont know much and the fact that they arent listening is not much for them as they have lived around like years already but us we are still in our teens and what they will experience soon enough is not going to be as major and bad as what us s with experience what this video has explained is not as bad as what others predict is going to happen she didnt take into consideration that there may be more and more wars going on when people want to save their homes what will happen to gaza all the tiny little islands anyone know what is going to happen to australia at this rate will greenland melt too
progress is moving so slowly because most people in power like ceos and politicians are old theyll be long dead before they need to confront the consequences of their own actions and thus their eyes are only laid upon money i expect to see the rate of climate progress slowly get faster and faster as older leaders die and are replaced with new ones who will need to face the climate crisis political and economic action is miserably slow right now but i dont think it will stay this way for much longer
i do my part not because it will necessarily make a difference but because at least my hands will be clean when children years from now ask us why we didnt do anything to stop it
the earth may mourn her voice so clear a future shaped by doubt and fear but turn your gaze to fields once green where natures call can still be seen in simple ways we mend the flow return to roots and let life grow
ill still be ten years away from retirement age and given current trends probably more like twenty
remember it doesnt do any favours to the world if you become too panicked or give up hope or go the opposite route and think this video exaggeration and dont fight enough we need to be cautious but we cant give up hope for if we do we might as well die now
the fact this is happening right now says a lot especially since all of this couldve all been avoided due to ignorance and greed
i think the biggest mistake we made is thinking that we still have time i live in the middle of europe and anyone can tell how much the weather is changing and im still very young so i really dont want to imagine what the future is going to look like im honestly so scared for all of us i dont have any hope until we actually start cutting off emissions but when is that going to happen
a salesman sells you a cursed hammer every time you use it one person dies by the time you figured this out youve already hammered lives away when you confront the salesman he gives you two options keep using the deadly hammer or stop building altogether he doesnt want you to realize you can just buy a normal hammer from someone else
at years old i am distressed to the point of not being able to eat without my stomach being a mess and not sleeping well at night thinking of all that will be lost in the future if we dont care enough to act now in the present we can do this i know many people are only waking up now but now is not too late
global warming cannot be taken literally it is not just about temperatures getting warmer the biggest impact of global warming on humans is actually that the greenhouse effect intensifies the instability of the global climate system thereby greatly increasing the occurrence of extreme weather for example the super cold wave will appear in central canada northern united states and other places in february super heavy rains occurred in the beijingtianjinhebei region of china in july the most severe sustained drought on record occurred in the brazilian amazon from july to september so for the sake of your own life start paying attention to environmental protection
its already very bad in semarang central java indonesia im from there a lot of my friends are there and back in march it was raining very bad i remember i woke up i look at my phone and all of my friends in semarang said that their home is flooded the road is flooding they cant go to work they cant go anywhere it was just very bad
those who dont want to see will not see most people live as though they are immortal until the day they die
its nice to be optimistic but not this time adapting climate change ai wars and present regimes requires a radical transformation in our day to day life i think no better solution could be taken other than focusing inward not outward
and my parents wonder why i dont want any children
the more i study humanity and the environment the less hopeful i feel my degree in environmental science only made that feeling stronger
isnt life turning worse than better many are giving up hopes of having children already its not gonna be the sweet life anymore
love that you still follow the optimistic time frames for temperature rises instead of the more realistic ones where opec and tipping points bring the rises much sooner
it is really frustrating that while the situation has become so serious a significant majority still rejects climate change and portrays us as a group that scares people for no reason
unfortunately we are just too overpopulated to be able to turn back now there are already news reports saying how bananas and other fruits and vegetables are becoming harder to grow because of extreme weather and heat waves it would take the majority of people to protest and be on the same page but most people just dont get involved and its too overwhelming for them to think about climate change the sad part is we have the technology and ability to change things but people just dont care enough to try and really push for change
there are fires in states in mexico right now most of the country doesnt have water the president built a train for which millions of trees were felled temperatures in february in mexico city soared to c no the video is not exaggerating
back when all countries agree to save the ozone layer
we are already facing the effects of climate change in a major way winter this year has been absolutely haywire so i am afraid that there isnt much time left if any
showing this to anyone who asks me why i dont want children in the future
governments merely taxing people higher is still essentially doing nothing
were already at the point where people cant afford groceries and housing will be solved by everyone being homeless aka thrown in jail for being homeless in america at least
this is too positive i don t wanna imagine what will happen when the food value chain will start breaking down prices soaring massive migration unemployment airobotization it will be literal fight for survival in many places law of the jungle that if course if we miraculously avoid the world war that s been looming for years now and which seems to be our direction
and this is the projection only if our models are correct if there exist any tipping points such as the permafrost melt or the change in ocean currents that we havent accounted for the projections are too optimistic
saved this video will watch it again years later if i still alive
our problem is that we are you are too optimistic and hope that the worst scenario could be avoided but the signs of that are showing for years
all good but if we are actually in climate crises the temp rise may not be gradual but exponential and cross degrees or more by as early as
i wont lie ive all but given up hope for real action i wont be having children in this life time
its very easy to lose hope but there is still time to stop the worst from happening if we dont do anything now this will be our future but if we take action we can at least decrease the consucuences
the worst part of climate change is that the first people to be hurt will be those with the smallest margins and minimal safety nets people like subsistence farmers and reef fishermen meanwhile people in the u s will still be complaining about high gas prices that are still lower than what most of the world pays emissions regulations unsightly wind turbines and solar farms and refuse to participate in international agreements in the name of national sovereignty and before someone tries to claim that china and india are bigger problems india consumes less than half the energy the u s consumes despite having more than four times the population china does consume more energy than the u s but the u s s per capita consumption is more than times higher most of chinas energy goes to the industrial sector while less than onethird of u s energy goes to industry and the u s devotes more onequarter of its energy to transportation which is a small sliver of chinas energy usage yes china and india have serious environmental issues to contend with but the u s s contribution to emissions is very disproportionate to its population so it has a disproportionate responsibility to combat climate change sources bp statistical review of world energy
south african here our government will just blame the heatwaves on apartheid as for the rolling electrical blackouts thats just a regular day
its one year after this was made sadly it is now worse with little happening the excellent ideas and new efforts are being overwhelmed by the consequences of what has been already set in motion were at the degree now vaya con dios
more people need to know that climate change isnt just about things getting a little warmer
the climate change effects finally hit my hometown and state in the very south of brazil here in porto alegre rio grande do sul entire homes are completely underwater its like a war scene in the entire state
this is truly a bleak prediction of the world there are so many good and innocent people out there who deserve a future where their dreams and ambitions can come true i stand with these people to help build a better tomorrow for us our children and our childrens children
the summer in delhi is killer man
i kinda had an anxiety attack watching this specially because whats happening in brazil right now search rio grande do sul state and news
weve already hit the temperature
this scenario seems more plausible than then one in which we take action
i believe in humanity we will make it right every small step matters
protect our planetreduce waste use clean energy and plant trees to stop global warming and ensure a healthy earth for future generations
i do a lot of research and watch many documentaries and the news and we like to have this optimistic outlook on climate change but we are doomed even with renewable energy sources and electric vehicles we dont take into consideration the mining required for it for instance i made a video on the effects of mining and mining for these minerals destroys ecosystems and pollutes water sediments dissolve into the water and a lot of sea life dies and becomes unlivable because of pollution
this is really best case scenario at this point so much energy spent on watering down the grim reality start telling the truth even if populations will stop participating in the unsustainable system at hand for the love of everything tell the truth
were already at degrees celsius above pre industrial levels at the very least well be at degrees celsius by if we continue on our current path
thank you for creating this we need more people prioritizing this issue i understand its difficult as people are most concerned with their monthly bills and raising children but at least having a conversation about the issue and all coming to an agreement that we need to do something i think the fact that the future seems to bleak and that the only solution is to modify our lifesyltles such that we cannot have such luxuries as kept this in the back of everyones minds hopefully we can all take action before irreversible damage is done
the production and consumption of fossil fuels is currently at a record high and according to the planned investments even that record will be exceeded tomorrow with billion people the future does not seem bright
this makes me want to cry we are so helpless and powerless
what a time to be alive
its sad how in climate predictions like these those that are the most affected are usually the most disadvantaged countries whereas st world countries and such can still find means to work around the climate crisis really shows climate change isnt just an environmental problem but also a socioeconomic problem
what many people dont realise is that the main cause is actually the animal agriculture so if we really want to stop climate change habitat destruction and deforestation etc we have to stop consuming animals products meat dairy eggs leather wool etc and of course its a complete moral failure if we dont simply because of the unimaginable pain that it is causing to other animals and the health problems for humans as well
investing further into nuclear and ending the oil and coal lobby is one of the biggest steps we can take away from climate change
they showed this at school today
bleak nah thats the best case scenario you just described
there was another time of great drought in the united states during the depression it is depicted in john steinbecks book the grapes of wrath we will always have challenges in this life it saddens me that the younger generation feels there is no hope there is always hope we must ensure the fabric of our society is not destroyed having a safe society is the most fundamental need for having a secure future
we will not avoid this future avoiding this future depends on everyone working together we will not a significant chunk of humanity is against taking appropriate action this will happen plan accordingly
concrete is said to be responsible for of global co emissions we need to readopt building with sustainable materials like bamboo and sustinable timber it is both asthetically and environmentally better for the world
we wont be here by its painfully gut wrenchingly obvious too much too soon we are already far ahead of where i thought we would be in
my argument is just the first two world wars wouldnt all of those carbon emissions killed the planet a while ago if you look at it closely then youll see just how little there is to worry about i am willing to debate anyone on this
you should have mentioned how diet impacts the climate its a major source of emissions
a couple years ago it reached degrees in canada on vancouver island this may not sound like a lot to hotter countries but to the people and animals here it was devastating fish floated dead in lakes people left water out for birds and wildlife which struggled not to die on the side of the road from the heat wave it was bad for the people too who are accustomed to ranges of to degrees celsius a significant portion of our seniors could not cope with the sudden change in temperature and died hospitals were overrun by the younger generation which did not die but still suffered heat strokes due to not everyone being able to afford ac and biologically not being climatized to such high temperatures we are talking about people who go around in shorts in degree weather theyre used to producing and retaining heat not dispersing it it was a record breaking temperature for the area it could have been a freak incident but if we continue as we are im sure eventually it will be normal and we will lose a large fraction of our wildlife if the change happens to quickly we may continue to see people die because they simply cant cope with a temperature flux that far out of their bodies normal
one thing that stood out to me was the focus on renewable energy and how critical it is for shaping a sustainable future it made me think about how our everyday choices now like reducing waste and supporting green technologies can contribute to a healthier planet for future generations
this kind of stuff brings me to tears every time
im almost a sure that humanity will not change enough and that money and greed will rule until the very end
recently the calamity that happened in the phillipines is yet another example to a huge list and we still have people of power in the strongest most affluent countries in the world that deny climate change and refuse to invest in technological infrastructure to improve anything
this is so timely since the philippines is already facing these issues
watching this after the us presidential election and feeling utterly defeated trying to keep hope
ok watching this was my most challenging task of the day the emotional intensity of the reality with this crisis is tough but important to hear and share with others so we can try do our part if not governments
i think that this stuff would be so common that itll hardly even make headlines in general
anyone else old enough to remember al gore telling us what the s were gonna look like
regenerative farming practices is vital
this knowledge must be spread and concern across the world to every single individual as soon as possible or the nature will make sure that everyone will know in the end
im surprised we can still remain optimistic in the face of climate change
world leaders after seeiing this prevent climate change from getting worse starting wars to get more resources
this scenario largely assumes a modern world dropped into the climate of i assume not including technological soultions was a deliberate choice advances in automated farming vertical farming and precision fermentation could circumvent the food crisis
six months after this was posted weve already blown through degrees of warming degrees c looks like it will be here far sooner than we are already experiencing many if not most of the effects this video highlights perhaps its a bit too optimistic time to get ready if you can
people need to control their consumer habits its the only way learn to discipline yourself
but were not continuing as is the us is actively making things worse
imagine doing this and still assuming the same neoliberal society would persist with its countries governments schools and grocery stores and such thats ideology you live in a regime that is contingent on historical material circumstances historical conditions change and the regimes change also
humans trying to outdo asteroids floods and viruses
weve only known about industrialism causing climate change since s cant say we werent warned people just chose short term gains for long term pains
if its that bad then i can only imagine how much worse it is postsecond impact in the evangelion universe
we have actually seen a decent amount of countries across the world take steps towards investing in greener solutions so there are actually stuff being done im actually mostly impressed with china who has invested a record amount into green solutions like solar and wind power i didnt expect china to take such a big initiative in this endeavor it seems they understand the gravity of the situation they may even see it as an opportunity to be at the forefront in this china is actually doing more than the us when it comes to green energy at this point the orange man in washington doesnt believe in climate change so there wont be any progress there for the next years when it comes to climate change im saying this because its easy to think that nobody is doing anything but thats just not true we have made progress its just not enough yet so we gotta keep making progress that progress relies on our political will to continue everything relies on political will from both politicians and voters
this is one of the main reasons im not having kids theres no way im bringing kids into a world like this
i think the video is not quite accurate since it shows climate change just as an inconvenience on the lives of people of developed countries the fact is that one of the first things it will disrupt is the global economy this means that all the globe will feel the consequences almost equally although it sounds worse the bright side is that it will force the economy and the rich countries and the companies to finally move their asses in an effective way not just bullshitting with the current green washing so in the end i believe we wont reach this scenario the disrupt in the economy and pocket of the rich world will prevent it
id hate to be the pessimist here but id say we continue as is were well out of time
it sad that this is probabbly one of the brighter possible futures
i was in the hospital during a wet bulb event near me so many elderly people were in there for complications with helath conditions related to heat stroke
during covid lockdown england had clear clean sky i wonder why
it already crosses deg in delhi now more issues we might start living in bunkers due to uncontrollable ai unstable govt due to less and less job opportunity who knows what else
sniff this video really upsets me i just hope we fix this pollution problem soon i dont want it to get any worse
i think this video is overly optimistic to anyone reading this think about the people you know friends and family and the people you run into in life how many of them are concerned with global warming hardly any they dont know they dont want to know now think about the political sphere the right wing and at right are ascending personally there are some things i actually agree with like enforcing border controls or keeping islam at bay but on global warming they the altright types are global warming deniers they dont believe it is hapenning or if it is its no big deal now think about the fossil fuel companies and fossil fuel nations do you think theyll ever walk away from the greatest source of wealth the world has ever seen i dont think so its great to see electric cars and the rise of solar etc but i suspect its all greenwash its still just a drop in the bucket
i am convinced that we passed the absolute point of no return in the year things are now running out of control faster and faster the domino chain has been triggered
not one single good thing in the future
atypically a common adversary is the great unifier the icebreaker
its too hard of a problem to solve because the hardest part is changing human nature
trump project yeah is too far lets speed up things
life always finds a way to balance something happens that shouldnt it will be balanced
i may not be perfect but have changed to protect earth and provide my child some future of not seeing certain plantstrees and animals in museums in my s and sucks seeing ppl in charge of politics not care
people seem to care about climate change in two minutes i have seen the amount of views of this video go from to people that have viewed this video
i am a student who lives in korea as you can see in the video when climate change becomes serious things that will happen to us are very scary and scary we should try to prevent climate change as global citizens living together on one planet our small actions will create a great miracle
what a joyful video man i just feel so much better after watching
all the optimism at the end can now be negated with the reelection of trump drill baby drill the yacht class will be fine but the rest of us are doomed
this video is starting to look optimistic its now looking like degrees by
its already too late the damage is done enjoy things while they last
really seems like capitalism is the main problem
well the currently trajectory is definitely not going to improve if not get worse more likely the current projections will come true
america is the greatest country in the world arguably but the people are resilient and surely wise enough to know what is happening and which oil corporation is pulling string on politics to deny climate change
thats years from when its uploaded
the golden billion plan will solve all these issues dont worry
i am currently a student in korean middle school watching the video and seeing other countries suffer such damage makes me think about the environment again i think if i try from now on i can increase the global golden time wouldnt the earth be able to live a little if we quickly save carbon emissions and energy from now on
the only thing i disagree with this video is that we still have time to stop this we dont we sat on our asses and lost already at best we can minimize the effects of whats gonna come and adapt but untolds amounts of suffering will prevail for a long time as birth rates continues to decline everywhere and more and more people decides to not have children given the conditions here in brazil we are having some previews of the shitshow that is come a record breaking dry season with tons of fires happening everywhere on the country and the flooding of rio grande do sul and the current projections are not reassuring in the slightest im glad i didnt had children and im looking to get a vasectomy
and then you get trump thats it thats the end
this video got a sedep bener grade i have no idea what they are talking about but im sure its scientifically great
id love if teded would also explore the human adaptability to this bleak scenario like new indoor farming methods or aquaponics since the outside is no longer arable not to encourage complacency but sigh what else can we do after we pass the point of no return
i appreciate how clear this was
im years old born and grew up in holland emigrated to canada saskatchewan in i believe climate change is real experienced it myself in europe as well as in canada as long there have been humans on this earth we have been burning wood and later on fossil fuels coal oil etc none of this ever changed the climate not even during the industrial revolution in the s the changes in weather patterns did not start happening until the s why you ask me after wwii the world population was approx billion people this has grown to approx billion and still growing we all contribute to co pollution everything we own has been made in factories that burn fossil fuels of some sort most of us drive cars that produce co but all this pollution is more ore less at ground level in my opinion the biggest pollution that affects our climate is the enormous explosion of airline traffic look at the contrails in the sky all co and water vapor to kilometers high trapping the heat at lower levels the amount of fuel these jets burn is enormous a takes on about tonnes a close to tonnes all that is burnt in the upper atmosphere and everything comes by plane nowadays not just the millions of people that fly but the amount of cargo is immense something else that is never talked about is the massive amount of oxygen that is required to burn all that jet fuel so we take the oxygen out of the upper atmosphere which is very thin already and we leave co and water and a bunch of other pollutants up there how good is that for our weather and of course all these planes completely disturb the natural air currents that take place up there but according to our governments that only contributes only to climate change i think they forgot to put a zero behind that so this is only the jets what about all the rockets we shoot into space for space exploration and to bring into orbit the thousands of satellites that circle around the earth they leave a massive amount of pollution in the stratosphere and damage the ozone layer that protects us from solar radiation this is my explanation of why climate change has only been happening since the last or years i invite anyone to comment
lol when i was in school they told us it would be this bleak in
i think people will adapt and migrate we are seeing some of these predictions already some are exaggerated market forces will fix some of these problems but its all true
we hahaha you mean the very few billionaires who are causing this dont you
how we can prevent this can you share about this video
capitalist reality calls itself realistic while it is a deeply magical irrational belief the belief in infinite growth on a finite planet do we really want to capitulate to an ideology that has persuaded us to destroy our environment and to call it without alternative the true realist position is therefore to recognize that the continuation of the status quo means guaranteed catastrophe the true realist today is the one who insists on the necessity of a fundamental alternative the utopian is no longer a distant fantasy but the only pragmatic survival strategy
earth is not dying earth is just adjusting itself to eliminate human beings
im glad to be in my s and not have to live to see such a bleak future im grateful to not have children to worry about
you didnt mention that the air will no longer be breathable
the sky is falling doom and gloom sells
wow mind blowing good information video
the earth changes overtime its nothing we can do the earth will fix itself
clear and straight to the point
its hard to balance hope and optimism on the one side with doom and gloom on the other this video errs on the hoptimism side a bit what is needed to meet those hopeful outcomes that avoid global famine and food price inflation by biodiversity conservation equivalent to lower sea traffic noise as soon as possible energy efficiency increase per year transition off fossil trade by cut fossil trade licenses and permits of todays level per month down to zero by to motivate transition in time avoid methane emission by keeping it in the ground when possible capturing it to use if necessary flaring it if unavoidable scrap fossilemitting equipment as soon as possible so it cant be used elsewhere harvest and plant biomass equivalent to a trillion trees by
this is very optimistic looks to me we have massive food shortage many unlivable parts on earth and catastrophic situations in the seas in years
another one to add to failed climate predictions
and the old people who created this mess are dead
awesome content as always
how about you stop making these speculation videos saying we still got time and actually make a video in years saying its over time has run out there is no fix and the politicians and the rich hoed us
on a side note i am proud that i got a tesla best decision i ever made however i always get bashed on facebook by the out of touch republicans trumpers because they are sooo against change against climate change definitely dont miss going to a gas station i charge my tesla nightly in my garage never needs an oil change tuneup no spark plugs to replace never need to go get an emissions test love not contributing to air pollution its pretty much a smart car love being part of the future ps i just have to laugh every time i drive by a costco gas station that has long lines
people keep blaming rich people you make them rich
this is so so conservative tell the truth
its gonna be so much worse than this video portrays and much sooner too
devastating effects of climate change lol
they said the same thing years ago
if i had the change i would destroy all oil companies they are the number one cause of that disaster
sorry to burst yall bubble but these will never happen yall i loved the animation though
great information thank you
this is total rubbish
this was so easy to follow
this likely speeds up as well many predict as unlivable
really enjoyed your perspective
we need to plan ahead
i think we should probably start to do something
global warming is a significant and pressing issue that is having a profound impact on our planet industrial activities such as those carried out in factories and steel mills release greenhouse gases into the atmosphere this pollution not only contributes to global warming but can also have severe health implications for individuals as these harmful substances can enter the lungs and lead to serious respiratory problems and even death addressing these challenges is crucial for both environmental and public health
media like this will never reach its intended target when it talks in terms that are not understood by said target as much as i wish it were otherwise most americans dont have a clue what degrees c means and theyre not inclined to learn it either
the writing is on the wall but were seemingly all deaf and blind pursuing our own selfish misguided ambitions including our governments there needs to be a fundamental change in how we all live on this planet if nothing is done to bring a meaningful and pragmatic solution everyone everywhere will experience the disastrous effects of our own indifference and apathy
people could just stop eating meat but instead they wanna blame politicians
this deserves to go viral
this is great i just shared it with my th graders
worst case here sounds optimistic by we are looking at another degrees on top of now most likely due to feedback loops another degrees and degrees warming by
they wont stop they need to be stopped
hold corporations accountable boycott all conventional food brands boycott technology corporations and ai and support sustainable businesses
why is the need to reduce consumption of animal products not mentioned shifting towards a more plant based diet would reduce greenhouse emissions significantly
its going to look like this by
this deserves more subscribers
i dont deserve this kind of future but humanity as whole does so i accept punishment from nature this is logical consequence of our greed
everyday im staying at the same place feeling useless that i cant help to save the world there is more to do but its the government we have to go through them as they are the responsibility of our nation
i think we are too busy fighting with each other to care about our planet
if we do not do the impossible we shall be faced with the unthinkablemurray bookchin
glad its only could this is the most extreme and unrealistic projection of the future based on the most extreme outlook of the climate models and climate alarmism
its far past time to get serious get smart and dont give in have kids and teach them to fight for a better world by almost any means
in delhi is pretty normal
in south africa the drought problem is made even worse by inaction and corruption in the government i live in the eastern cape near port elizabeth and for years we keep seeing the same pipe leaks go unfixed i saw a statistic somewhere though it may have been exaggerated that more then of drinking water from dams are lost due to pipe leaks and crumbling infrastructure look up day south africa the drought has passed the ec now but the underlying problem remains
simple and well explained
just take a look at the recent temperatures you dont have to wait till
we are already past this is pretty rosy compared to reality
gods vast earth can heal its fully capable of doing that internet consumption isnt talked about much but is one of the greatest causes of carbon emissions and water wastage wonder why people dont talk about it much it may be cheap but its costing us our invaluable resources tech giants and billionaires need to be taught a lesson
we will probably live in a dystopian future where everything doesnt matter as long as life goes on
if scientists are boon for the earth then businessmen are bane for us
i like teded its like reading a book with video visuals
just came back from peru of the glaciers are remainingthis is a very very optimistic video have you seen the deforestation video on youtube about rondondia in brazil
bummer but its the price we must pay to ensure a small number of people make huge profits so its necessary
i had to give up watching this and read the transcript instead because the background music drowned out the narrative you have a message to present so please let us hear the message
i studied this topic extensively in college and people didnt wanna hear it back then these predictions were obvious possibilities over years ago but because there was active political suppression scientists provided conservative opinions and the message was poorly delivered the more weve learned the more obvious its become that things are much worse than weve allowed ourselves to believe accept its only when we choose to face the truth that well start to change
commitment we humans agis and ais commit to choosing assumptions we make about ourselves and the world around us that most help us to honestly deeply and actively nurture our self all others the earth and what is beyond we agree to be and support leaders who embrace nurturing and we withdraw our support from those who embrace disregard we can assume that almost always the more nurturing involved then the better the decision and almost always the more disregard involved then the greater the ignorance we can assume that nurturing is the reason for our existence and our reason for going on we can encourage others to make the same nurturing protocol commitment
what happens if we do nothing isnt that whats happening on the planet already
acharya prashants operation is a movement he initiated to raise awareness about the urgency of the climate crisis and its potential consequences by the year the operations name is derived from the target set by the united nations conference of parties cop to limit the global temperature rise to no more than c above preindustrial levels by acharya prashant highlights that this c threshold has already been crossed and he uses this fact to emphasize the need for immediate and drastic action operation aims to awaken people to the reality of the impending climate catastrophe and encourages them to revisit their priorities and take responsibility for their actions he argues that the climate crisis is a problem created by the rich but paid for by the poor and that a fundamental change in human consciousness is required to address it
perfect explanation
can you relate can you relate to the code in your veins the spiral ladder where lifes truth remains each twist and turn a mystery we chase in every cell a legacy we trace can you relate to the dance of the strands carving the future with invisible hands mapping your past in the silent exchange a language so ancient but never estranged can you relate to the pattern within blueprint of all that youve ever been every moment each breath that you take is guided by bonds that will never break can you relate to the story it weaves of struggles and triumphs of roots and of leaves from stardust to soil from sea to the land the code of the cosmos held in your hand can you relate to the rhythm of life in chaos and order in peace and in strife the answer is there in the core of your being the essence of truth in the code youre seeing
this falls very short on what we need to change green capitalism and disconnecting from fossil fuels is not the solution capitalism has to end quickly or it will end us
me after watching this yup were cookedliterally
fossil fuels is one of the issues but the biggest issue is agriculture habitat destruction we need to change the way we farm eat i honestly think vertical farming with hydroponics under ground will be the best thing if you have acre of land you can build a floor subterranean facility underneath it to create or so acres of space add tiered vertical farms on each floor and youre at acres then restore the land above the farm back to nature
if they were really so worried why would they allow hugely populated countries like china india and russia to just carry on regardless china has over coalfired power stations here in the uk we are being penalised when in fact the uk is responsible for less than of world carbon emissions so if they are so concerned about it target china india and russia so the next time someone talks about net zero say by the way did you know that the biggest polluters are china india and russia not the uk the uk accounts for less than of carbon emissions
i remember learning about the imminent ice age in grade school in the s
in wisconsin our january winter will be in the s usually its under it has felt like summer for months now i dont remember it being like this ever i live here for the cool weather relief but its fading i want to move even further north maybe west
first half of this is present tense otherwise disappointing tepid conjecture
oh what it will look like in years from now exactly the  same as it does now
drought and flood always ring a bell that they have no idea what climate change will look like
yeah this is gone happening in the future we need your help to save our earth
well do worse than nothing of course humans are a selfeliminating species
what i can do i cant sit ideally by listening all these
temperature in delhi is above c in summer i think we are already living that worst case scenario of
its time to rip off the bandaid we have halt entire industries textiles and fashion construction petroleum refining drilling and distribution and we must change agriculture globally we cannot depend on corporations to reduce carbon emissions they have to be shut down
changes are noticed in northern europe too extended periods of rain and then heat wetter and warmer as time passes obviously this could be confirmation bias but the more this pattern repeat itself along with objective measurements of global increasing temperature the more sure we can be global warming is an issue for sure but one should not underestimate human ingenuity i believe someone will find a solution eventually but slowing things down until then would be a good idea china just made advancements in fusion which are hopefully accurately described fusion reactors energy dependent carbon capture could reverse this in the future i believe state governments should put more resources into research rather than limiting production fusion for example is most likely a viable future endless energy source use the gains of now to secure our future
itll be interesting to see how the grid will cope once e vs are being charged globally sometimes i consider the shutting down of coal plants too soon during the greener transition
im so scared dont worry though because lots of money will fix the problem
im so scared for the earth and its future so many animals are going to go extinct and lose their habitats its all because of these old idiots who run our world dont care and the consumer the earth deserves better so many innocent creatures and beings deserve better its there home too
they cant balance the budget but they think they can control the weather
who remembers reading their weekly readers newspaper for elementary students in the late s and they were trying to scare us with cartoons portraying how life would be for us after acid rain and the ozone hole had overtaken the earth images of children playing outside in spacesuits ala nasa complete with helmets and the life support backpack
its comforting to think when the human race has gone the earth will recover to become a beautiful planet again
years later nobody alive now would still be alive to experience the devastation of climate change
we need to help this beautiful earth that god gave us
consider the amount of unrecyclable diapersnappies that a baby uses each day per year for up to years dumped in landfills seas and oceans
reusing broll across formats is an efficient growth habit
this why i refuse to start a family cause i dont want my children to suffer
us humans cant do it alone at this point i think jesus gotta come back now
darn thats the pretty picture im hearing more dire predictions than that optimism is good but not an excuse to wait any longer best of luck humanity
this is the path were committed to
dogs and cats living together give me a bucket people
i will be in i will not even be old i will live through this babies born today will experience this their whole lives
more government can do anything competent let alone bigger issues government expansion is too slow to solve existential threats and destroys economy at the same time which slows down adapting and learning in current environment nuclear energy goes effortlessly far enough and at the same time improves economy
this was a masterpiece
unfortunately i feel like the mentality is well ill be dead so why should i care but our children and grandchildren will care
whos the speed runner oh wait its multiple people trying to get first place
celsius is about degrees fahrenheit for you americans we should probably do something we need to do something oh my god please
as earths economy crumbles further marss economy is reaching new milestone of investments
for once start showing what the world might look like if we do the right things that is a far more powerful motivator to change things for the better
this is extremely optimistic
i think the message needs to be hopeful and positive regardless of any realistic outcome thats how well achieve the best possible outcome even if that outcome still isnt enough to keep humans on this planet indefinitely
the key word is could might perhaps etc fear mongering at its finest the earth has had much warmer periods but through fear people can be brain washed
the problem is production of batterys and energy for themis not as clean as you think it is better to drive gas cars than producing electric
what a great content
i guess we really are the last somewhat healthy generation
this horrific scenario is the best outcome but is hitting in all likelihood and possibly in the s theoretically it is not to late but we need to reduce emissions in every sector by in every sector in years to hold c
we are on the titanic except this time its sinking over years instead of hours take advantage of those years we have one thing jack and rose didnt a heads up on the future use it
cywilizacja popenia tyle bdw
the collective action part is stop eating beef i know its delicious and i agree with you but what are you willing to give up for your children and their children
i would say this is a bit of rosy picture considering the ipcc worse case scenario is c by nothing in the last years has happened on the time scale they anticipated always faster always more intense than expected we are past the c mark now not or good luck
we need to move ourselves and the things we produce around less and make the things that we produce last longer
the farmers can not work outside because of the deadly heat
were dying but still deliberating whether we should try putting iron oxides in the oceans to stimulate co capture and we still refuse to generate sulfur dioxide against global warming
we who are poor in many southern countries did little to cause this problem but we will be most affected
why would we do nothing if were allowed to use energy well adapt like we always do
human existence combined with technology has undoubtedly impacted earth however for decades now scientists have exaggerated how quickly we are eroding the planet therefore im skeptical anytime someone addresses this topic forecasting impending doom im not advocating for ignoring climate change but scare tactics from experts in the past mostly hurt the cause when their basic premises fall far short in reality its as if saying look years from now at our present trajectory things are going to be really bad wouldnt be enough thats what should be said instead people are treated like sheep that wont do anything because it doesnt affect their immediate future so we get these shortened timelines that never occur and the critics rightfully say although the data suggests there was a negative impact this didnt have the gigantic impact you claimed it would years ago why should we believe you now
a sobering look at the potential future of earth if climate change continues unchecked
the record high temperatures are going to continue to rise food crops livestock will die this rock we call home is going to change faster than most think
human must stop globle and live liked the past
this is so satisfying
theres a great documentary which refutes that climate change is man made its called climate the movie the real truth its eye opening a must watch
deepdives can outperform broad summaries when curiosity is high
weve already reached this point
gamified elements points streaks increase engagement
since we are doing nothing and new research shows we are heading for the worst case scenario this will likely happen by
dang looks like interstellar is becoming true
i live in nvnevada out in the southwest of the usaus my state and other southwestern states have been in a megadrought for years since
i plant trees but then i see the village destroying a small forest to build a cement stream as a shortterm solution to flooding caused by the longterm problem of global warming
most of the young people i know do not want kids and have almost zero hope for a future home family they are largely fatalistic about the future
we are very clever idiots
onscreen timers add urgency in challenges and speedruns
not gonna lie im shaking scared reading the comments im getting my degree and i wanna stop cause whats the point if i dont have a future to use it this is so sad
i wish everyone would quit being in denial and actually address the climate catastrophe thats upon us there has been zero attempt to do anything about the accelerating rising temperatures among other climate tipping points like i said last year is going to be a drastic climate change
we do not have to give up fossil fuels we just need to stay below a certain threshold we can still use some while the planet fixes itself we are just using way way too much right now its not sustainable enough to do this because weve already used so much even if we cut off fossil fuel use right now it will still warm a bit and then start to go down
i dont agree that any fruit and vegetable products will be unavailable or superexpensive by little of it will be grown outdoors by then superfruits with incredibly high yields will be grown in indoor farms for most of the worlds production well find a way around that part of the problem but the displacement of people in poor cities will certainly happen thats of course if were not eliminated by ai long before then but thats a whole other video
might be we are always focusing about problem what we have until forget dont realize environment all around us
in the middle east we already hit way back its c everyday and c in some areas in saudi even before summer started and it just started
developing nations will suffer most from climate change and benefit little from the existing emission
imagine whats gonna happen in the future if this problem keeps getting worse and worse
warm voiceover tone outperforms monotone delivery
moore yelled the same when i was a kid sea levels are rising im now and moore is rich and the sea lol still salty only
then again it might look differently thats how settled science works
while its impossible to know how the next decade will unfold let us present to you the worst possible scenario
to all ppl who are pro war pro genocide like with the palestineisraeli war or simply dont care at all wars and genocides cause climate change actually its the most important factor that cause it and pollution diseases natural disasters happen as a result that affect the whole world not only the targeted country
treat our network security as highly as personal safety and actually punish cyber crime
who the f is optimistic about any of this there is no way we will avoid the ecological catastrophe
based on the climate scientists i follow on x and elsewhere and based on some papers ive read the outlook of this video is far too optimistic especially the positive music towards the end seriously
billion batteries that have a temperature of degrees celsius but no one dares to say it there are too many people on earth
and we are already pre industrial levels
good news is we have the solutions now we just have to stop burning fossil fuels
my mom millennial says she doesnt care about this stuff because shell be dead by the time itll affect her
one of the main cause of climate change is car dependency i am a cyclist yet for some reason everyone including those who believe in climate change hate me i literally saving earth by not using cars
lost me at the sound of sirens blaring through the night like theyll send ambulances
so far none of over alarms by experts have come true
as long as they dont ban private jets and cruises im not convinced that it will work out
just one simple question how is the weather in your place how fresh is your air
went through this in the s w the energy crisis nothing was solved
it will be chaos very quickly the people doing well from being very wealthy will find so many people struggling a nuisance thats what the problem will be
private companies wont solve the climate crisis especially when the incentive is still constant growth and profit governments cant solve it in a capitalist framework especially when corporations have enormous power to sway legislation and regulations individuals could perhaps make a change if the capitalist world order is challenged by a critical mass of us and real overhaul is agreed on if we try our cute little interventions here and there just to look like were making changes the picture is likely bleaker that in this video
i dont believe we will need to wait until to see this come to fruition i think were on the brink of it now and well probably see most of it happen by unless drastic changes are made now but its impossible because even if every government and corporation in the world did everything they could to achieve net zero we wouldnt get to net zero for a decade or more its just too late were going to suffer our children and grandchildren will suffer that doesnt mean we shouldnt do everything we can right now its just being realistic about the expectation if we get to net zero by well need to continue we need to pull out the green house gases from the atmosphere to get us to the preindustrial levels net zero just addresses emissions we need to address whats already in the air
this all sounds like a great time
the funny thing is if we do nothing it would ne great for the earth if we change nothing however that would not be nice but that isnt doing nothing we are actively destroying our living environment
welp were already seeing it
and none is capable of stopping those responsible because of money
co carbon dioxide composes th of of the earths atmosphere
if for over a years earthlings didnt create new sources of energy and humidity makes it deadly for farmers to come out then humanity is indeed doomed
i though it was going to be like most of the last few hundred million years till before the ice age we live in there was no snow or ice not even winter the poles that have months of total darkness life on earth was booming much more so than the last few hundred thousand years
its always what happens if we do nothing im curious whats going to happen if we do what were going to do
by be prepared to somehow consume plastic instead of fish from the sea maybe sargassum sandwitches if youre lucky
less wind turbines and solar panels choking our countryside and seas more open spaces greenery cattle and crops
use public transportation as much as you can carbon emissions come from transportation go on a vegan diet carbon emissions come from meat and dairy industry dont bring more than child in this world as more humans mean more consumption and therefore more carbon emissions like and share videos related to climate crisis organise protests in order to pressurize the people in power to tranistion towards renewable sources of energy
hi guys here are some ways we can help with climate change a small act goes a long way plant trees or buy a plant save electricity dont keep on using ac dont use too much plastic instead switch to paper stuff recycle dont keep on charging things that dont need to be charged we got this
it will be just like it is today
we think we are killing the biosphere so slowly itll never know however itll come at us like a nuclear fiasco totally unexpected
well trump said drill baby drill so the us certainly is not going to do anything
this video paints a grossly underestimated version of it says we breach c and even c apil by but cmon guys we already breached c in and in were up to c apil by we may have breached c apil growing crops near the equator will be nearly impossible and billion people will be forced to migrate to higher latitudes if theres anywhere that will let them in also the standard cliched hopium message at the end that our situation is improving is completely counterfactual
why no mention about the biggest and easiest thing we can all do to make a change according to oxford university study change to plant based diet
seasonal surges in search often align with global events or releases
um sorry folks global consumption of fossil fuels continues to increase not decrease year after year and weve likely blown past degrees already these trends show no sign of stopping or reversing in the near or mid term future
we are consistently doing something co emissions at an ever increasing rate which will remain that until everything burns
are we considering the growing impact of ai data centers
continued deforestation cuts into not just the carbonsink buffer of forestry but also in oxygen production the acidification of the ocean also does not bode well for oxygenproducing plankton even if they might shortly flourish such an unbalanced surge is not sustainable finally we continuously talk about the greenhouse nature of carbondioxide but few seem to pay attention to the dioxide part this is atmospheric oxygen that gets burned up what has happened to global oxygen levels since the industrial revolution and how close are we to the critical point where births will be at extreme risks of resulting in stillbirths of otherwise significant complications due to oxygen levels dipping below the threshold
lets not kid ourselves it will be like this
at this point im no longer angry im scared
in the s i was told that by we would run out of oil and be riding horses like our ancestors by we may have a limitless source of energy from hydrogen or other sources if tesla was right which i think he was cancer heart disease may be cured public transportation may be safe and convenient so as we can use it deep poverty less than a day may be eliminated we might have a much nicer world by
pls try to make a well researched video summer days in delhi touch the c mark very often with a few days even nearing the c mark
humanity is slowly being cooked alive with no end in sight while the rich hide behind their built in contentions
ok the widespread blackouts and ambulances blare through the night is an extremely exaggerated take widespread blackouts for any given city in the us europe and asia the electric output has increased along with the added need and the cities that currently use the highest amount of electricity per capita tokyo london beijing arent even warm weather climates warmer temps resulting in more ac usage days per year and incrementally more ac on number of days not going to overwhelm the power grid more than the above cities building of hundreds of new skyscrapers commercial and residential buildings etc each year blaring sirens of ambulances of heat stroke like in the us phoenix is f in summer for weeks and heat stroke kills about people of its millions of residents per year heat related deaths of americans in total each year like this could be multiplied and it still wouldnt crack the top for causes of death in the us and likely top for ambulance rides
boomer caused you mean the parasite generation never wanted to pay anything in but want everything out without earning it
we need to stop multiplying like rabbits
the average global temperature was degrees warmer during the hot cretaceous period and we are still below the mean temperature of the last million years more recently the rate or sea level rise for tge last years or so was about times more rapid than the last years our ancestors used their sophisticated survival skills to determine that walking up hill was the solution those choosing to live on the coast will suffer losses and i shouldnt be paying to protect them from their choices reap it on a brighter note canada would be a wheat producing powerhouse come up with something that i should actually be concerned about and i would be willing to invest my dollars into fixing it
use consistent tags for series to cluster recommendations
parts of these consequences we already see today we need deep systemic changes which are very hard to come to and it seems we as modern humankind will need bigger shocks and disruptions to our lives to really wake up and change our ways sadly in this case necessity is the mother of invention
just to inform you delhi is already facing temperatures
tough to be optimistic when yo oil billionaires have disproportionate influence over us energy policy
severely downplaying the issue
the un needs to do something now
i heard about a youtube video about a paradox when theres more heat they should be less aggression because of more stress when its hot but its actually the opposite theres more aggression we dont know why so global warmings could be one of the reasons why crime is going up
there is no evidence to support your optimism global consumption of oil gas and coal is still rising according to the latest data as are global co emissions promises by politicians were never worth much but today they are at an all time low if you look at geopolitics
audiences reward unique angles over generic summaries
stop capitalism save the climate
note this is already happening now has become ill be making the comment longer but emissions are not going to stop because of governments theyre going to stop because of resource limits
main reason population meat industry fossil fuels and plastic th mass extinction already started
the there is still time meme is getting tiresome its too late and the best we can do is reduce the harm by whatever degree the rich and powerful will deign to permit if you are poor hard luck if you are rich watch your back someone will come for you if you are old well done youll miss out on the really bad bit and if you are young sorry peeps we shagged it for you
during covid earth breathed and became healthier
we dont need to wait into we already passed the degrees last year
according to scientist earth is around billion years old long before humans existed here there has been huge changes in the earths climate this is not the hottest its ever been this has been proven by ice core samples from the arctic
i dont believe we can limit the increase by or even degrees c by more likely or even which means that aerosols will be spread in the stratosphere god help us
why is this so scary
forgot to mention the severe groundwater quality and lowering levels
weve already blown past the degree limit we just dont realize it already
human climate change the climate has been changing for billion years cant stop wont stop
hopefully this comes to fruition cause life sucks anyways
its not could anymore its will
and what about the diseapearance of the warming sea currents glaciers melting bring fresh water in the sea that modifies the whole system earth is far to be a simple mechanism
above all the anxiety i have and its been days since i cannot operate anymore as a functional human being only by thinking of this i hope and i wish nature does to us what we have done to her so those rich selfisj garbages feel the same as vulnerable populations
i feel like the earth will look different because the government in the earth spend may years working on buildings in just a lot of things like the ground i feel like the world will just look different in be different
this is what happens when life across the board as a whole is dared to be measured by a dollar
wrong question its not what happens if we do nothing we will do nothing because we can do nothing enjoy the now
i hate to say it but these predictions towards the end of the video are for not we are looking at breaching c by circa
make it and rising take a look at venus c at the surfaceit is possible folks we dont realize
the exaggeration in these made up scenarios to try to incite paranoia is kinda ridiculous the manufacturing of electric cars alone is far more harmful than the usage of gas vehicles
the worst thing you could do to accelerate this reality is to have a child
acid rain and holes in the ozone are my biggest concerns
the earth will stop getting hotter each year is when we completely stop burning fossil fuel
the mother nature shall strike back at humanity
i blame it on jane fonda scapegoats help right the antinuke movement is why we arent all driving electric vehicles in the end we all die so do how and when actually matter
so what can we do to avoid this i live in an undemocratic country we cannot vote for better leaders we cant afford solar panels or electric cars we cant stop using cars i am an student i cant donate money to any environmentalist society what can i do
if earths climate is heading in this direction by do you think well be investing more in climate engineering or simply learning to adapt to a hotter more unpredictable world
they didnt mention how there wont be any marine life to speak of in about years
dont forget that we get health problems at ppm co we are at ppm
why im seeing star ad now do nothing
entire nations like marshall islands and tuvalu will be uninhabitable yeah and square miles nations what a pathetic attempt to scare us into submission
there is only one little issue that you all miss heat goes up cold goes down according to the latest data from the international energy agency iea the global estimates of co emissions by source for coal natural gas and oil are as follows comprehensive table with the final gas coal and petroleum co emissions analysis and results vs total annual co in the atmosphere from all emissions sources fuel source co emissions from combustion contribution to atmospheric co ppmv percentage contribution to ppmv natural gas billion tonnes ppmv coal billion tonnes ppmv petroleum billion tonnes ppmv total billion tonnes ppmv
this is very optimistic collapse from overshoot has been entirely avoided in this scenario even though the climate is one of the biggest drivers of collapse
delhi recorded c f today in not c in
trump has done the exact opposite of all of these solutions this guy puts profit over everything including humanity and the planet
use low displacement engines
you forgot the billion stop in population between and
for porto alegre brazil my city of birth it is now too late
way to go guys lets shoot for
but the atmosphere was much warmer during roman and mediaeval times and the human race survived the measurent of global warming depends on the starting point and climate scientists dont agree on it different climate models produce different figures
stopped when it got to the bit about weve still got time to make things better noticed how old this is before us election
greed profits is the name of the game
dear i dont think were gonna survive
yeah my kids would be my age if i have kids at like i plan if this happens in i like the video but in future videos rather than hearing words like higher rates and more severe i would love to know more specific projections with examples
meat is a huge contribution to this but people dont wanna cut down nor eat a veggie burger because they hate change well it will literally kill us
what would it look like look out the window when none of the climate scare comes true there will be a lot of stuff hitting the fan
its already exceeded degrees c wow
earth probably have lost me in
in india temprature has reached degrees
weve already gone past degrees c without question
by we be past c above preindustrial levels better wale up to reality we just did that in which was c above average in total fossil fuel consumption reached a record high worldwide driven by a increase in oil usage and increase in coal usage exceeding gigatonnes of co for the first time in history in india fossil fuel consumption was up in in china
i thought we already have passed the target as of a few months ago
we are so close to this may happen in
i fear trumps reelection might have tipped the balance in the worst way possible tt
shannon odellas phd is in medical sciences why are there no videoes on climate change from people with relevant degrees
correction it would be in new delhi
years ago projections were made and we are still alive
the bits you miss immigration goes ballistic as vast regions of the world become uninhabitable for example too hot major unrest occurs as countries become isolationist and try and stop the immigration but they cannot millions die due to unrest and displacement wars break out as squabbles over millions of displaced people major problems of death and disease due collapse of food production due to flood off the chart hurricanes and heat waves decimate farm land and s of years of food production cycles wars over water occur as countries divert rivers and cut them off from downstream countries major loss of life as more and more wars take hold over food and water major displacement of people in inside countries such as the usa where the amoc fails causing loss of coriolis affect off the eastern sea board and large rises in sea levels making manhattan and other areas inundated with sea water rich people take shelter in enclaves cut off from the rest of the world the oil industry doubles down to look after the rich and powerful economic collapse as the top world economic powerhouses collapse under catastrophic failure of the stock market due to instability in economic models major starvation and death of populations as social economic collapse takes hold across the world the world is fine as it finally rids itself of a parasitic organism humans
i remember scientists in the s saying that we were going to enter a new ice age so as you can imagine i am sceptical when it comes to humans knowledge of the planet we are all guilty of destroying
so what why does it even matter we all will die someday anyway what does it matter how or when we die none of us was even asked if we wanted to be here who says that its our responsibility to make sure we protect our environment i say we all need to relax and just do the best we can and dont take life too seriously
summer day seems cold unless youre talking celsius but im not sure bc it wasnt specified so ill assume fahrenheit
this is unavoidable now science denial is openly celebrated and scientists are treated with suspect
the moisture clearly does not want me to find out
probably see a once beautiful landscape covered in solar panels windmills for no good reason
how many billions will it take to change the temperature of planet earth
mr trump just sped up the clock
aint no way ur gonna catch me riding is a goofy ahh electric car
i will be years old in
the first half is happening now already
we are already too late
use polls to prioritize upcoming experiments
what will happen if we do nothing nothing
c in delhi in may way over the predicted here
these videos need to stop saying theres still a chance to reduce the worst of it were past rhe point of no return on a lot of things already people need to start making decisions now with that information im not talking about buying an electric car i mean dont buy houses in high impact areas or strlart a business requiring things sourced in those areas ect hope is dangerous ehen its covering up whats coming already
what a onesided biased report why dont you talk about how warming up can bring loads of benefits to northern countries and the fact that the earth had experienced many much warmer periods of time in past history such as the famous dinosaur era when all sorts of plants and animals flourished
we are blowing through the one point five mark already people just have a think
so tell the people who own private jets stop lecturing me i never fly
it doesnt matter the world will revive but humans wont
i remember watching this same type of video years ago and we were told we were headed for a new ice age
its industrial civilization itself thats the problem
many religious people are erroneously celebrating claiming their invisible ghost is coming back to save us
of swedennorwaydenmarkthe netherlands own an ev now vs the stuck in the past america which is at a sad however california is well ahead of the rest of the country gas coal oil production is sooo yesterday already we need to move away from these antiquated sources
its funny how its ok can be read as it sok
when climate hippies make years into the future more dystopian compared to the world years ago
these predictions sound eerily familiar to the predictions of imminent disaster i heard of when i was in high school in the mid s i am now and life seems good to me as a matter of fact in toronto we had the warmest winter in recent memory it was awesome
governments are worried about depopulation but i think th at might help
those who are making the most money from polluting will still make out like bandits
rich people omg there is global warming me let the galaxy burn
i fear ending fossil fuels could trigger a worldwide depression
we have already blown past deg temperature rise so we better start beefing up the grid now either way we will need it to distribute solar and wind energy or to handle the huge increase in air conditioning and for sea level rise we are not talking water world its only m so if we stop all new construction on land that is less than a couple of meters above sea level by the time it floods it will only be old buildings getting destroyed and ffs dont rebuild in a flood zone relocate to higher ground take some common sense measures now and you can minimize the damages to come
capitalism is a getrichquick scheme for those who already own capital and as long as this is the economic system were running with profits and wealth growth will always be placed before people and the planet capitalism is our biggest obstacle to solving not only the climate crisis but literally every other crisis weve created over the past two hundred years
how bout we stop doing anything and leave it alone stop consuming
i can relate to planet earth because i also get slightly hotter but significantly more unstable every year p
everything here is already a reality in cities like delhi
please spend more time talking about the million to million displaced people who will travel to cooler places
they should stop thinking about who get right color or not and start thinking about planet
if you look at the movie elysium as a predictor the colonization of mars is intended only for the wealthy elite so the ones who will pay the price for their sins after the world is used up and in disrepair is the rest of us
by wed have solved entropy by then
yapp yapp yapp people have been screaming about the end of the world for over years yet here we are
i can bet it will be worse if it continues like this
when i was little we always had a lot of snow in winter and summers were warm and nice with temperatures around degrees celsius now there is almost no snow which sticks for longer than days twice per winter and in summer we frequently have several days with around degrees after which we always have terrible storms with hail and strong winds which destroy things and sadly it will just keep getting worse
or we can just launch space lenses in front of earth at the l legranch point and block of the sunlight idk why nobody is talking about that
we will accelerate pollution not decrease it not a chance we will stop burning carbon for energy they will water golf courses around los vegas till the day the taps run dry period
numbers in titles promise structure and are easy to parse
yet we have politicians still drivng in gas powered cars
honestly i think the only thing that can save us from this future guven thr current state if affairs is geoengineering
certain things make sense and certain parts are normal interglacial spike to flip to ice age
its and weve blown past c of warming
this is like the baptist that keep coming up with a new date of when jesus is coming back
july celsius global warming xd weeks a go i had to turn on the heat cause it was celsius global warmings
unfortunately this video may be underestimating the amount of warming in decades ahead as the latest research by james hanson and others indicate
there is the trend of world depopulation to consider so although the population might currently still be increasing many believe that itll take a sharp turn and start to drop off drastically over the next several decades i wonder if that will change the course of climate change
as trump rolls back americas environmental protections this video finds its way into my feed future generations we are sorry
we already there more people dying of heat wave
food challenges invite participatory comments and remixes
dont worry be happy most of us wont be here anyway
lies were screwed its way too late just live your life happily every day
you should probably translate this video into mandarin chinese they are the main perpetrators right now of carbon increase
makes me want to drive my big pickup truck
hilariously optimistic
but what about the profits the important part is not who suffers but who can afford not to so sayeth capitalism
if gavin newsom doesnt burn everything down earth will look in pretty much like it does now with cities being more populated and roads more heavily traveled but thats about it
what if we increase our fossil fuel use as many governments and politicians are advocating for
to rub salt on our wounds most of climate change is due to only of super rich greedy people who have gathered benefits of captialism at cost of human lives and environmental damage
there are more trees now than there were years ago the atmosphere is about co the wildfires that happened in california were completely newsomes fault he was so worried about the delicate ecosystem that he allowed brush buildup to occur which caused the fires to spread as fast as they did he couldve cleaned them out but chose not to the firefighters were fighting just to get water also due to the failures of newsome trump got the water turned on
this is now happening in your data is outdated
trump wont be around at this time and that is why he doesnt care but his kids and grandkids might be here very sad
peak civilization will hit around to after that population will decline economies will decline countries will fall wars will increase famine will increase global warming will get worse pollution will get worse this will be due to lack of new raw materials to push growth further far too long have humans relied on the planets resources to fuel growth for cities economies and populations easy to reach resources will be used up harder to reach ones will cost a lot of money driving up the price of good the way i figure it we have about to years to enjoy our current way of life before drastic changes are needed
million you say more like billion displaced andor deceased
what earth in will look like
still not enough being done
were past the turning point
in the early s they were saying in years we would be feeling the impact a few years ago it was over f regularly this year it reached and topped the feels like temperature of f for weeks on end im retirement age we didnt need ac hardly anyone had it we had a few days when it could get up to the mid s in august the nights were always mid to low s you used fans to blow the cool air in at night and then shut everything down on the sunny side of the house to retain the cool through the day this year and last the nightime temps were near or over f about years short of that year mark
climate change is an issue that should not be handled by politicians neither the un but rather by competent scientists and reliable decisionmakers
well be the first civilization to make ourselves extinct because saving ourselves wasnt profitable gg
the good news is the bay area has a lot more birds than it used to have ever since the military left and the heavy industries left the wildlife has really come back strongly we only had pigeons and seagulls back in the seventies but now there are cormorants pelicans and a bunch of other marsh birds little and big around the bay the water is clearer the air is cleaner really its a little success story
worried about the coastal redwoods which greatly rely on fog for water in the summer their leaves turn the fog into precipitation and water droplets fall to the ground its really cool
we have so many micro climates but we need scientists input not politicians or business corporations we need micro detailed solutions many areas are pressured to cut down trees wells are becoming unpredictable la should stop housing growth due to water issues
so good to see that communities are taking action every little bit counts we cant just wring our hands and be paralyzed by the inevitability of change
born and raised here in the bay honestly i love the fog it has always been a big part of living in the bay and i cant remember the last time ive seen fog it went from all morning till about noon and would start back up at night and now i dont see it at all climate change is real
impeccably presented thank you albeit a dutchman i grew up in the bay area in the s and s i now live again in the fatherland in glorious middelburg i no longer have a car and i walk cycle or take the train everywhere i am doing what i can to save the planet in my own small way
its the saddest thing ever to watch this place fall apart and we wont do anything about it this whole thing was on a fine balance that is destroyed i keep wondering when the food supply will suffer from all this heat years left
regarding the fog as a life long san franciscan i noticed the last years that the fog carl is less often than before to reduce climate changes every country has to be on the same page
maybe we can quit monocropping grapes up here in sonomanapa and do something more useful with the amazing growing climate we have
your state is so freaking cool from an outside perspective i hope you guys can get the tools legislation and plans in place to preserve your home truly one of the most incredible parts of america and one of the most majestic and magnificent regions on earth you can do this we can do this i pay attention to know how to help and to learn the things you guys can teach us here in the midwest we love you cali
my father grew up there in the s onward and its gotten warmer as the years have gone by ive noticed the same since attending college in the early s to now its definitely warmer i really miss that fog sf used to have
this big push to force everyone back into the office for work isnt helping as more people continue driving and using gas its just making the problems worse but these older people in top executive positions could care less and they wont be here to see the aftermath of what they are doing all for the sake of controlling and micromanaging their workforce
defensible space thats about short of what is needed in the wildlands
wine is a critical food source luxury stop driving building flying and living extreme consumption lives its actually gross
i think we should allow for some waterfront streets to become canals instead
imo the biggest crisis in the bay area is that it is over populated and over priced fixing the homelessness problem should be priority growing up i was taught that if you had a full time job youd be able to afford to live and have a place of your own even if you were making just minimum wage the fact that a single person has to make close to a year in order to afford living comfortably in the bay area is the real disaster
wow thats a lot of airtime for wine growers with nothing said about the impacts of wine growing on communities rivers ecosystems groundwater ad nauseum mendocino county native here that wine segment just showed how much bs this video is
sun exposurerelated issues in the s s and s was lower than today
i am in awe that there are so many people in the comments that actually believe climate change is not a thing oh the bliss of denial
i moved to the northern oregon coast years ago after years in the bay i noticed the change in climate before leaving what surprised me after meeting new friends and neighbors on the o coast many lament the change in weather less fog and drizzle and more summer heat and extreme weather this includes neighbors that identify as climate change deniers
i live in ca and in the past years the temperature swing has been about degrees hotter and colder northern ca can reach f and and the bay area the fog is almost gone
it is a beautiful landscape its a special place
as long as we have an economic structure that depends on continuous growth well keep marching toward failure the actual fundamental that is relevant is that energy and materials are necessary to provide products and services do energy and materials replenish at the rate of consumption lol no neglecting the second order effects of the waste products and process of acquiring energy and materials the whole concept of continuous gdp growth ad infinitum is a fairytale is there any serious societal move to address this lol no were in for some serious
this is an important message
pretty sad we are leaving a mess for our kids beside the massive suburban sprawl into the valleys wine vines are a toxic huge monoculture that has destroyed much of the trees bushes grasses and natural habitat for birds butterflies and other wild animals
ohhhhhhh i know what i want to be in my next life a fog researcher
ive lived in san francisco for years i first noted decreased fog about years ago its a real issue
every nation around the world needs to do its part to help combat climate change but thats just not going to happen in the state that were in wars need to stop people need to get educated in these poor countries pollution is still an ongoing issue etc
sad that i wont be here for it id like to see how this plays out
at this rate humanity might not make it to
much discussion about wildfires is centred on the damage to properties but surely it is essential to consider the destruction of wildlife habitat and forest ecosystems the consequences of climate breakdown are not just a crisis that affects human interests and business profits it is causing massive losses in biodiversity and pushing many species toward extinction we share this planet with millions of other species our interests alone are not the only consideration we caused this crisis and some may point out that we knew as long ago as the late th century that our activities would lead to global warming due to the release of co we certainly had very strong data by the mid th century that co emissions were such that the climate would warm if we continued as we had warnings were in some cases intentionally disregarded or subject to a concerted campaign of denialism many people are making very positive changes in their lifestyle but those who do not switch to sustainable energy use do not stop burning stuff and eating a meat based diet remain complicit in perpetuating this crisis
optimistic decades no sorry years maybe change by people not going to happen its been fun tho right well for humans the rest of life not so much we had the perfect paradise but we used and abused it because we could and now people cant believe that all life is going to suffer for what we have done
there will be feet ft of  on every corner
the last foggy summer in the avenues was summer i distinctly remember a specific day of how the fog originally was in the sunset and havent seen a summer or day like it since
its wild that a very small percentage of earths population are responsible for the continuation of its destruction
what they wont tell you is that sea level is rising mmyr while san francisco is subsiding mmyr
rise in temperature chart doesnt make sense temperature rise is accelerating and wont decrease in
ca is a huge producer of animal products which is a huge contributor to climate change i heard about the need to curb fossil fuel usage but no mention of dealing with animal husbandry to mitigate some of the worst predicted effects of climate change when is that episode airing
the paradise storm was a perfect storm that could of happened anywhere i was there and still remain people need to be prepared and keep propertys free and clear we cant possibly prepare for it all i mean we had feet of snow in now the longest heat wave ive ever seen here in
im in agreement with stopping conventional development
its true for years of what you said but we can reduce the effect by peace be nicer and good mind use our thoughts and actions to move the one who is controlling all these calamities befalling onto us change wickness instilled into us by the wrong society our action brings the karma we are facing sadly nobody believes in this now because humans become arrogance selfish greedy dishonest ungrateful egoistic jealousy its not the weather that gone crazy its us human
wow foot waves in january thats wild and terrifying
i accepted to come to this meeting to have a sober and mature conversation im not in any way signing up to any discussion that is alarmist there is no science out there or no scenario out there that says that the phaseout of fossil fuel is whats going to achieve c sultan al jaber president of cop also ceo of abu dhabi national oil company mukhtar babayev will be the president for cop he is also a former executive of the state oil company of azerbaijian republic seems more and more likely scenario ssp of the ipcc assessment may come to fruition or at least the higher end of the spectrum i say enjoy what you can while you still can pity the generations to come
the modi government has taken several steps to address climate change including netzero emissions target india has set a target of achieving netzero emissions by as announced by prime minister narendra modi at the cop summit in glasgow renewable energy targets the government has set ambitious renewable energy targets including gw of renewable energy capacity and has announced plans to triple renewable energy capacity by mission innovation india is a founding member of mission innovation a global initiative to accelerate the clean energy revolution and achieve the paris agreement goals green gdp prime minister modi has suggested the concept of green gdp which takes into account the environmental consequences of economic activities climatefriendly policies the government has announced several climatefriendly policies including a rooftop solar scheme electric vehicle manufacturing and biofuel production international cooperation india has played a key role in international climate negotiations including the paris agreement and the g summit and has called for global cooperation to address climate change
great job very interesting were late but its still time to act
the song playing in the back ground goes hard
the united states is the largest source of historic co emissions in total combine that with our gluttonous consumption on a per capita basis and no nation can touch us chinas emissions exceed ours but of their co is from manufacturing guess who is the largest importer of chinese goods its the good old us of a i doubt anyone has done the calculations but id bet that the bay area might be responsible for more ghgs than any other part of the us co is highly correlated with wealth transportation is the number one cause of emissions for sfba ca us we should be tearing down freeways fully funding transit and putting bike lanes on every bridge merchant corridors should be carfree change or perish
good luck san fran with your political environment there are much worse things in your future than the weather
preparing for sea level rise port of san francisco plans feet lift by feet lift by those elevations are about twice early ipcc estimates for sea level rise which indicate a cautious approach however ipcc estimates are heavily affected by political influences that have been conservative if the estimates are inaccurate and many climate models predict substantially larger rises which are supported by unanticipated changes that continue to be observed then the effort could be insufficient to address sea level rise yes the effort costs money maybe responding with incremental change will prove cost effective i hope so though i have grave doubts
super bien cool attention futur
building homes on sand is as crazy as a loonytune the cost of water front properties is beyond the money i will ever earn and at years old i will never be able to afford living like a movie star the climate change is coming thats a fact like it or not a change is coming weve been changing for millions of years thank you
wishing the weather getting warmer in boston
a wine documentary
i was actually wondering why it was so foggy out here i was going to have some sun on the beach but suddenly the fog and humidity caught up on me
we still have time and fix this before its too late
its due to over population
amsterdam the capital of the netherlands has same issues with being inundated by the sea and about the fog that his quite troubleing because i think san francisco is so far south that highs in degree celsius or over degree faranheit are possible not to mewntion water management issues caused by fog absence
i used to have oceanfront property in texas but natural sediment moved the shore miles away scientists forget nature is more powerful than they are
as a bay area native thats been to the city always bring a sweater
it is possible to solve this problem wwe should cooperate worldwide
will the weather be crazy enough to slow the criminals
to save our earth we have to change our consumption and luxurious life style after that production is become less then carbon and greenhouses gases produce lesser so over all we have to change our habits is necessary eventhough search for alternatives
just pay more taxes itll be fine
the bay area has built up a lot and looking from the air there has been a huge jump in the square footage of solar panels when are heat collectors and thus change the weather as a result small changes add up over years
no mention of animal agriculture
mangroves can help wouldnt they
better than in ice age
they cant even predict the weather in the next minutes now they think they know the weather for decades haaaa
so when the sea never rises there they will say see we fixed it
we cannot do much or any prescribed burning due to the lack of a sufficient window of optimum wind thermal moisture conditions in british columbia most public announcements of a prescribed burn are cancelled it is like there is no spring season only summer and winter sooo now we are looking at biological vegetation management using cattle sheep and goats the goats do the best overall prescribed burning not literally venting index in march and april is usually too poor in the lower valleys i did prescribed burns for decades in the fall and late summer until we had too many escapes
oh back to year predictions instead of year predictions lol
remember when al gore said the united states would be underwater by these guys are all a bunch of liars
we are still living in and leaving a ice age more not we and the next generations have to adapt to that
these people are all dead jim
well done tells us the issues now convince the peoples of the world is time to wake up
shoreline erosion is caused mainly by offshore mining of sand for concrete for decades desert sand is no good for concrete
how about doin an original on blackonasian crimes which has largely been ignored by politicians and all media from the local to national level isnt that more public safety paramount and more important than the climate hoax
every home in paradise in bring your own brigade voters voted against firewise measures preferring to maintain the existing firerisk intensive ways of living has paradises voters seen the light and come around
nothing compared to the wreckage of progressive politics
the complex ecosystems interdependencies that developed over very long periods of relatively very stable conditions cannot withstand the thermal and hydrological challenges that are now occurring at an accelerating rate beyond the societal geological and habitat impacts described in this video essay relentless destruction of ecosystems along with societal proactive and reactive activities will all have addon effects beyond our dereliction in not sufficiently and appropriately acting to reform our occupancy of this planet these are and will increasingly act as selfreinforcing and compounding feedbacks in addition to others arising from natural sources such as increase in methane emissions and substantial increases of nitrous oxide both related to global mean temperature increases considering how poorly things are going it is very apparent that we need to deploy interim interventions in order to buy us badly needed time to undergo difficult but necessary changes two forms are particularly essential the first is drawing down of greenhouse gases leveraging natural systems to draw down co from the atmosphere could provide great benefit as promoted by russ george ocean pasture restoration could possibly take us a long way beyond controlling fugitive add ruminant emissions injections of iron salt aerosols into the troposphere could greatly slow down the rapid increases in the potent greenhouse gas methane by giving it an additional sink also on land regenerative agriculture and grazing with wilding and better water management deployments could be of numerous great benefits including reduction of both very potent methane and nitrous oxide emissions europe has recently mandated that both marine and land restoration projects are soon deployed the second type of intervention that is at this time crucially needed is temperature reduction we are currently at a crossroads and we cannot allow the destruction of earths ecosystems to continue preservation of what we will otherwise lose is actually more important than restoration biodiversity loss is tragic and contributes to the loss of natural sinks and their attendant release of harbored carbon this will likely put us over the edge as will temperature related increases of methane and nitrous oxide from natural sources science along with current major global climate impacts of greatly increasing magnitude now occurring seven times more frequently than in the s has made it amply clear that we are already in a possibly untenable predicament it seems to me that sciences continuing preoccupation about the details of how things will play out and societys focus on preparations adaptations and responses have become strange fascinations since much of our concern is being directed to things that of necessity should not be allowed to occur since we have the ability to stop much of it temperature reduction at least is not hard to achieve with solar radiation management and can be done much more coherently and constructively then what we are currently allowing to happen somehow we have been deluded or convinced ourselves perhaps as a type of selfflagellation to reject the good in favor of the unachievable perfect have we really so completely lost our way
i didnt know this was a comedy i remember when henry kissinger said if the deplorables wont believe global cooling well sell global warming to them and make a fortune
or maybe nothing will change same way sea level hasnt risen the way it was supposed too
the climate will be fine earths climate has always changed and has had moments of history when the sea level was higher than currently
need to stop the bitcoin miner plant or get worse
so basically give more money to politicians so they can fix it and of course you can trust them because they have such a good record of handling other peoples money efficiently this is a scam plain as day
the bay whispers of change as tides rise high our city our earth cant live in the sky come closer to soil to trees to streams where natures pure flow still gently redeems to heal the storm return to the earth where true harmony blossoms and springs new birth
the religious commercials during this are hilariously placed god aint gonna save us we had our chance in the garden of eden and the oil companies are burning it to the ground praise bigoil amen
years back they said you wont see another winter after
i suppose being hot is better than freezing and id rather not give pge anything more than necessary to heat my house
humans deserve mother natures processes for regenerating the earth
co could be the salvation as increasing co allows plant life to survive and thrive with less water and reverse desertification leading to larger crop yields to feed people wildlife and the added bonus of cooling the ground more co please
i cant even afford a house here so wont even be here by then good luck everyone who still lives here
i would be more concerned in the year solar cycle we are about to enter
earths boreal forests that occupy billion acres of north american and eurasian arctic regions which is of earths land area and comprise of of the forested land both the canadian arctic and siberia have been experiencing very high temperatures with persistent heat domes over the past several years canada lost million acres last year to raging wildfire that started more than a month prior to the normal fire season as a result of a persistent heat dome resulting in very low soil and vegetation moisture values the emissions from this have been estimated to be three times that of canadas annual societal emissions the same kind of stuff thats been happening in siberia for many years and somewhat in scandinavia and alaska as well integrated into the boreal forests are vast peat lands the worlds peat lands contain more carbon mass than its forests and fire has been burning into them in the arctic as they are dried by increasing duration of high temperatures oregon is in the process of losing most of its prominent tree specie the red cedar as well in areas closer to the coast douglas fir are having problems california which had earlier been reported to have million dead standing trees in the sierra foothills with much improved resolution satellite imaging it has been determined that mixed within healthier stands there are large quantities of dead standing trees making even these forests tinder boxes as well even in the areas that have not burnt there is a tremendous amount of attrition occurring within species that are otherwise highly drought adapted in spite of all the rain that we have had the last two rainy seasons and cal fires enhanced capabilities following the prior and current heat domes there are already some larger fires burning if you look on duty watch app you can see that there are numerous fires in oregon eastern washington idaho arizona new mexico border areas and now even in sparsely vegetated utah as well the amazon over decades now has been experiencing reduced precipitation and has been in serious drought recently to the extent that major tributaries of the amazon river had mostly dried up there are numerous areas mostly next to that which has been cleared by agribusiness operations which have been considered to have tipped on their way to becoming savannah if the amoc continues to slow down even higher equatorial temperatures will ensue as less heat is transported northward guaranteeing the unraveling of the amazon rainforest photosynthesis cannot occur in the prominent species there above f and none of the trees are drought adapted c species only the tropical grasses as such are able to keep their stomata closed during the day and will eventually take over from the forest it appears that the entire basin is at risk its area is huge at of that of the continuous lower the amount of carbon mass harbored there above and below the forest floor is multiples of that currently resident in our atmosphere
as long as this video is telling us the future why have they completely ignored the ever increasing carbon taxes collected by governments isnt all that money supposed to fix the climate why isnt that data not highlighted since after all that is marketed as the solution to climate change
as a transportation system planner i must object to the claim the only thing we can do is stop burning fossil fuels the problem isnt how we power our cars trucks shipping vessels air freight air travel motorized big boy toys etc the problem is how much we routinely travel by car and the unsustainably long distances we transport essential goods and household commodities the electric vehicle tech that offers most benefits applications and potential to reduce fuelenergy consumption emissions and insane traffic is wait for it plugin hybrid phev tech eventually utilizing combustible hydrogen in the icengines of phevh drivetrains phev tech is especially applicable to longhaul freight truck and transoceanic shipping fleets phev tech is equally applicable to personal cars vans trucks public transit bus fleets phevh tech can deliver more than twice the equivalent mpg possible in hydrogen fuel cell evs allbattery bev tech is most suitable for lightweight vehicles and short distance needs only the very smartest people can see just how smart the emperors new smart car is the bmw subcompact smart car is the smartest bev
we live in the same climate as it was million years ago and the cancer will go away i have an explanation regarding the cause of the climate change and global warming it is the travel of the universe to the deep past since may each day starting may takes us years to the past of the universe today may the state of our universe is the same as it was million and thousand years ago on october the state of our universe will be at the point million years in the past on june the state of our universe will be at the point million years in the past on june the state of our universe will be at the point million years in the past on april the state of our universe will be at the point million years in the past the result is that the universe is heading back to the point where it started and today we live in the same climate as it was million years ago mohamed bouhamida teacher of mathematics and a researcher in number theory
glad i survived the ice age they predicted in the s
america where the sky is gray and depressing so disgusted at a country who is so powerful and dont allow the sun to shine
you worry about nature destroying the bay the human will destroy it before nature can have you see san francisco now keep voting for newsom than good luck you dont need to wait till not just the bay but the whole california
if all californians would just quit driving their cars and move inland
this piece was written in chat gpt and siim voiced in audify no humans were involved in the production
important story right but why is everyone talking in question marks like you agree with me right
maybe they should ban straws again
yall should spend that money on replanting all the ecology thats been destroyed thats contributing to all the changes in each of your microclimates
the title should be how democrats will impact region over next few decades
bhavishya malika predictions is true
there are huge non climate effects of carbon dioxide which are overwhelmingly favorable which are not taken into account to me thats the main issue that the earth is actually growing greener this has been actually measured from satellites the whole earth is growing greener as a result of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere so its increasing agricultural yields its increasing the forests its increasing all kinds of growth in the biological world and thats more important and more certain than the effects on climate freeman dyson institute of advanced study in princeton new jersey
fog makes me nervous but its also pretty
coughbullshitcough no rain its a drought were doooomed too much rain were dooomed weathers beautiful yeah but
but jetfuel for airlines today is a gallon
cmon its never gonna happen
they said wed be under water by now aswell yeah right lol
if democrat politicians are so concerned with the carbon dioxide level in the atmosphere then why is it that they allow anyone who builds in any of their cities to cut down all of the trees and replace it with asphalt or concrete large conifer trees are the absolute best way to absorb atmospheric carbon dioxide instead of this they will give government grants to anyone who wants to build a ridiculous billion dollar carbon capture machine democrats are clear cutting forests so that they can build massive solar panel farms any of these solar panels built in deserts require billions of dollars worth of copper covered with crude oil byproducts to deliver this minimal amount of supplemental electricity it also requires a massive amount of electrical grid equipment that costs a lot more than the electricity delivered is worth youre wasting our time and money nuclear powerplanrs and coal fired powerplants deliver many more megawatts way more often for a lot less money and manpower hours stop wasting our money
co is not pollution plants take it in and release oxygen
the weather is changing o my god keep up the orwellianspeak one of those central planning years climate tax revenue without a reason without a service you are laughing imagining those who will believe you
liberal policies will destroy it well before
the more violent we become the more violent the weather becomes we are all one with life when one suffers all suffer wake up people
i just love some suggestion given by experts we need to change our habit
utter nonsense the latest ar report from ipcc working group i the science working group could not identify any global trends in extreme weather events though this statement in the body of the report did not make it into the summary for policy makers a politically but not scientifically approved document which appears to drive policy few people actually read the full text of the working group reports i have so significant findings are missed by the mainstream media extreme weather events have always been with us but though the costs of some events have been rising much of that cost is down to building expensive infrastructure in places where it and increasing populations should not have been allowed when corrected for population density and gdp costs are not actually increasing no individual extreme weather event can be attributed to climate change when climate is normally regarded as a year average of weather most extreme events can be attributed to local coincidence of natural phenomena such as the atlantic multidecadal oscillation which explains why the frequency and intensity of atlantic hurricanes is at present on a declining trend or the pacific el nino southern oscillation with its known influences on weather both sides of the pacific there are many other influences elsewhere leading to extreme events but global mean temperature does not seem according to the data to be one of them
it is good to have video that raises the peoples awareness of the climate change
lol humans wont make it that long well be lucky to see sorry kids
so yes or no on prop
if you want to change the temperature of the oceans set up huge water sprinklers just like everyone does to cool a swimming pool
tbh the best option at this point is to accept we fucked up and rebuild the parts of the city that are expected to be flooded more inland and help families relocate and demolish all the man made property thats in the path of the rising tides
does the media ever tell the watchers that we are in a solar maximum wait for the solar minimum
and whats the point of these documentaries not a single person is going to do that one thing that can save us all
thanks for letting me know im burning drums of oil a day going forward
a climate remediation suggestion there is a lot of discussion and no full agreement about global warming whether it really exists how serious a threat and the role of atmospheric carbon dioxide however the following is generally agreed namely that a lot of co has been released into the atmosphere since the start of the industrial revolution and a lot of it has ended up in solution in sea waters there is at least times as much co in a cubic meter of sea water as there is in a cubic meter of atmosphere at ntp this is acidifying the sea waters and possibly harming coral reefs and other fauna there has also been some agreement that the temperature of the earth has warmed somewhat the earths rotation and the coriolis effect has formed several tropicalsemitropical oceanic gyres within which the mass of sea water is rotating clockwise in the northern hemisphere and counter clockwise in the southern hemisphere anything floating i e less dense than sea water tends to float towards the center of the gyre there are five main gyres all of which are tropicalsemitropical they are the north pacific south pacific indian north atlantic and south atlantic oceans together they form a very large proportion of the of the earths surface which is covered by water the north pacific gyre has a lot of floating debris the great pacific garbage patch some of it being debris washed off japan by tsunamis following the recent fukushima earth quake the southern hemisphere gyres do not appear to contain much floating debris the north atlantic gyre is unique it contains the sargasso sea which is characterized by the presence of two species of sargassum which float by virtue of oxygenfilled follicles it was discovered first documented by columbus from his voyage in there is a sargasso sea commission with an office in washington dc which is charged with protecting the sargasso sea from pollution etc there is a website that basically describes all of the positive ecological values of the sea since the sargassum appears to be overflowing from the sargasso sea and moving via the west bound currents across the north coast of south america into the caribbean and sometimes into the gulf of mexico this has been attributed to agricultural run off from the usa or brazil but might be due to the increased levels of co in solution in the sea water it has been washing up on beaches through out this region as one might expect to happen when it dies and rots it emits h s since a lot of these beaches have tourism as their main industry the weed has to be removed manually which has given sargassum a bad name there are several facebook entities that keep track of sargassum landings and there are frequent postings enquiring about sargassum occurrence on specific tourist areas the occurrence of sargassum in the caribbean would however make it very easy to put live sargassum into the pacific off the west coast of mexico from there the currents would carry it all the way across the pacific photosynthesizing and growing all the way absorbing a lot of co and heat energy photosynthesis is an endothermic reaction absorbing co from the ocean would allow more co from the atmosphere to dissolve in the sea as well as reducing the amount of acidification the sargassum would probably stay in the north pacific gyre but some might drift into the south pacific one might balk at the idea of covering a lot of the oceans with sargassum but it does have uses it can be used to make ethanol paper or cardboard some one in the caribbean is making construction bricks from it and others are feeding it to goats if there appears to be some benefit from pacific sargassum we could easily add sargassum to the other gyres using ships that are transiting the panama canal it seems likely that some sargassum will eventually get into the south atlantic gyre but that may take a while i would welcome any thoughts robert o ducharme phd msc ba oxon rodincusaol com

how different is the climate miles east in sacramento
can you please make a to minute version of this that summarizes the main evidence or scientificallybased facts thanks
back in the late s when the kids were young we went camping every year after school was out for the summer i remember for days it was degrees as far as the wild fires the forests need to burn all the dead stuff of forest floors the native americans would do that but these days there are so many people living up in rural areas of the mountains these fires just dont start on there own unless of a lighting storm and that is natural i do believer something should be done about the plastic that is all over the place stop manufacturing plastic bags and straws period i am sick of the new media being so dramatic do we need to be informed yes but stop blaming everything on the climate change back in the s the bay area had a early spring by may i was tan then the following year we had tons of rain we were still snow skiing in june
seattle washington will welcome povertystricken people with open minded
so basically everything is linked setting funds aside to resolve an issue accomplish nothing give that some thoughts
look we have fiction writers making up all kinds of stories again these stories are not even well written
i just always was so mind boggled how movies really represented how the world really is so  scary even ufos jusr crazy man literally movies of pur downfall and we continue to do it
its not warmer in nj wish it was
a reminder years ago the bay area was covered in half a mile of ice
my inlaws used to live in paradise at tigertail lane i think it did not get burned
as observed from satellites a warmer planet is a wetter greener planet
i left my heart in san francisco high on hill well not so high anymore with all the flooding it calls to me to be where little cable cars most of them will be underwater climb halfway to the stars or at least to the nd floor of my apartment the morning fog may chill the air i dont care most people wont care because it wont be there what you should care about is climate change my love waits there in san francisco as long as he or she can tread water above the blue and windy sea no forecast for wind today or tomorrow so dont worry about your hairpiece flying away when i get home to you san francisco you probably wont find your home your golden sun will shine for me about hours longer and degrees hotter
im from the bay and i can care less about the fog
no one knows because well all be extinct by
it is degrees above the atmosphere only degrees on the surface degrees of solar heat gone blocked out by the co and other greenhouse gases yes they keep some heat in about degrees but they block out degrees for a net temperature of gilbert plass is the father of co warming his paper in the carbon dioxide theory of climate change started all this idiocy the first sentence of the abstract for his papers states the most recent calculations of the infrared flux in the region of the micron co band show that the average surface temperature of the earth increases c if the co concentration in the atmosphere is doubled and decreases c if the co amount is halved provided that no other factors change which influence the radiation balance you get warming only if added co does not change the radiation balance meaning the heat entering does not fall with added co before satellites all scientists worked from the assumption that the sun mostly produced visible light and little heat that visible light warmed the earth as the levels of co and water vapor blocked out all the suns heat adding co will not block out more incoming sun heat as the was so little coming in to begin with but this is wrong heat is the majority of the suns radiation of the suns heat makes it past the atmosphere so adding more co does change the radiation balance added co blocks out more sun heat cooling the earth and reversing the greenhouse effect which is what plasss paper said plass assumed that added co did not change the radiation balance so added co created a warmer earth but he was wrong added co created a cooler earth above only degrees below cooler earth hotter atmosphere the troposphere is getting warmer with added co not the surface the co in the troposphere is absorbing more incoming sun heat and getting warmer we are getting warmer but that is because the little ice age lia ended in the earth has been warming up since then snow has been melting and the oceans have been warming up with less and less cold left over from the lia the warming is accelerating we are going back to the earth that existed in the last interglacial period when iceland was baren of ice and the seas were feet higher than today years ago the seas were feet lower than today this is how it goes on the earth warm to cold low seas to high seas this is just the first time mankind has had the education and intelligence to understand what is happening neanderthals lived through the last ice age but they didnt know there was an ice age it was just the way it was earlier hominids had no idea that they were in an interglacial age all they knew was it was it was warm plasss work is on the internet just google and read it for yourself you only need to read the first sentence in the abstract

pushing this again i see its been years so everybody forgot
get rid of the cars make the bay area a walking area that would be great
whats the intro bgm i keep hearing it everywhere
fast forward to we are having the coldest summer on record since
the star way project as i already have commented on my facebook side or opening the fifth dimension for all that should solve the problem but it also means we have to all work together what you dont believe me then refute the experiment but i understand unprovability is the way they make their money
by there will be no bay areaperiodjust keep on waiting
simple solution is add a water tank at base concrete foundation dor drip water on all contrete foundation golden gate bridge can control all weather conditions buy some submersible water pump extract heat generate electricity power pump to pump cold water from bottom ocean up to top
grow the plants which survive sea water to save the coastal areas your artificial walls are not at all a permanent solution for the expected distortion a d damage to the communities resyore the coast as it was in the beginning before the the occupations and development develop
grow something more drought resistant and adapt your methods everyone will have to adapt and change some more than others
i find it odd more people worry about climate change when nations have the nuclear arsenal to destroy earth positive thing about climate change is aquatic life will prosper
if all humankind switchoff do you think that samething happen on earth in shortterm
alternative life style
dame the fear mongering in this video is out of control
i dont know if i will be around after years lol
very imortant to note
the population is increasing every year wasting a lot of natural resources and producing a lot of toxic waste how can we solve climate change from the root cause of population expansion thanks
reasons to get pana m residency
every solution to solving climate change raise taxes transfer more wealth to rich create tax breaks for corporations who go green transfer more power to politicians micromanage regular peoples lives more and take more of their rights and property away
ya been here since nothing is any different if anything we are getting more rain like we use to get in the s straight propaganda
ill be hope ill move out by then lol ive always think that our generations are lucky in a way we havent experienced natural disasters major wars like our grandparentsparents did but maybe im saying it too early we might experience them at the later age hope not
back when we actually managed forest undergrowth forest fires werent so uncontrollable the first time a drove along the san bruno causeway in the bay water level is where it is today the explanations are the same as theyve been for decades these government workers need to stoke up the fear so their employment stays secure iethe homeless problem if they actually resolve the problem their employment is no longer needed
but for greed and our wealthy and sycophantic redcons choosing themselves over others wed have an adaptive resilient society big money has always plagued our state
we expect to see el nino of
i love these scifi docs
so paradise was burned down to fix it
think ill start buying up land in humboldt now
i wonder if taxpayers are paying to rebuild these already rich peoples homes
first thing that needs to happen this housing bubble needs to burst in now way is this sustainable nationwide let alone what has happened in cali banks and investors have to take a bath home prices need to come down minimum
now theres a bad fire in chico bigger than paradise in acres i believe sad
did they just spell vulnerability wrong
im disgusted by the way we talk about the dangers of global warming and the rise of sea level how it affects our economical growth and the wildfires are in fact a danger to our properties in the meantime nothing will be done to bring back these manmade conditions and disasters if we want to protect our living space we need to start at the beginning how humans live and treat mother earth we want change but not at the expense of economical growth under trump the whole process will just accelerate even faster
is years from now
climet change is normal climet is controled by the sun and eaths rotaion the eath changes every yrs
buy and sell yes the other
i agree that climate change is a problem but we do ourselves no favors to make hyperbolic unfulfilled projections like projecting ft sea level rise by i asked chat gpt what to expect they said by sea levels the east coast is expected to see a rise of to inches to centimeters the gulf coast to inches to centimeters and the west coast to inches to centimeters
why is climate changing rapidly can anyone tell me please thanks an advance
does it matter urban areas are long proven heat islands all the buildup holds heat dramatically no news here move along currently the bay area is largely a homeless encampment hopefully temperature shifts will make living on the streets less viable
but if the west antarctic ice sheet with seven feet of rising seas goes i think before and most climate scientists believe it is now inevitable before the result of raising bay defence by two feet from rising seas is only temporary a two degree c rise globally means a degree c rise on land areas so californias agriculture may be gone before unless it can survive a to degree c increase in temperature this decade which will also destroy industry and commerce there so going the full seven feet now may be more economical besides individual efforts by towns cities and states are all being made useless while fossil fuels and global warming are allowed to continue globally until which i also think means a degree c increase at least by then and that for land areas means just degrees c in global increase which passed the degrees c in to give local protection measures viability and success the global problem is the priority to be solved while american emissions continue thats doing you no favours and when you add african asian european south american australian and nz russian and canadian emissions this will make u s efforts locally a waste of time in the long term
sun drenched summers in sf not likely maybe in the surrounding cities in the bay area
geoengineering is responsible for all of these weather changes and more learn at geoengineering watch

the best thing about having these prognostications on video is having evidence of their faulty predictions once gets here
doesnt anyone get it yet we have engineered our own demise the planet will survive humans probably not
hahaha this is flat earther zero science how did the earth cool and have glaciers make long island and then retreatcycles of the sun and orbit of the earth moon galaxy might make more sense shhhhhh

climate change is the norm aka iceages yes climate woke ppl will probably tell you iceages are caused by human pollution
betting that in years some climate scientists are going to find that this is baloney
glad i am older we did this
funny there is so many megarich buying their houses on waterfronts without any preoccupation but hey climate change
zoom in from a better place
look in the sky are there stripes like with a ruler expanding over time we are told it was condensation but those would dissolve quickly as it would be due to different temperatures while the plane is still to see dane wigington on youtube has got some explanations
keep having kids tho
why does california hate things that make living affordable for people we are on a small rock that orbits a dying star in space no  the climate changes we need nuclear energy and to be energy independent california electricity prices now secondhighest in u s our power grid cant support everyone having an electric vehicle the batteries are not good for the environment when you dispose of them and poor people cant afford them they also need diesel powered generators as it turns out of all ocean plastic in the world emanates from countries in asia this is mostly from plastic trash in rivers that empty into the ocean the philippines alone accounts for percent of the worlds plastic ocean trash and india makes up in fact less than rivers that are mostly in asia are the source of over of plastic in the oceans the united states contributes just of the plastic trash in the oceans china and indonesia are the main sources of plastic pollution for single use bottles packaging main bags polluting the oceans this study estimates that china and indonesia alone are responsible for around million tonnes of plastic waste ending up at sea each year plastic ethics just companies have been the source of more than of the worlds greenhouse gas emissions since since october a staggering billion gallons of raw sewage polluted stormwater and trash have flowed down the tijuana river into the tijuana river valley and the pacific ocean closing numerous san diego beaches and sparking major concerns over public health risks coastal water pollution and the degradation around of fastfood workers are years old or younger compared to only about in other industries younger workers particularly teens are on average much less productive than older workers because they have not acquired the experience skills and education of those who are older allowing e fuel blend could save california drivers billion at the pump annually economists at uc berkeley and the u s naval academy found california drivers could expect to save cents per gallon if the state allowed gas stations to sell e fuel a blend of percent ethanol and percent gasoline approved in all other states there are no crude oil pipelines into california refiners in the state have to produce cleaner gasoline from crude oil than other states meaning other states gas cant be supplied directly to california stations the high fuel standards cost more and california imposes the secondhighest excise tax after pennsylvania on wholesale oil the state also imposes higher taxes at the pump than other states paris climate deal we were hindering our own economy with regulations and transferring wealth to nonwhites for that benefit being that the paris agreement builds upon the un framework convention on climate change we should have withdrawn from the unfccc this would have allowed the us to withdraw from all subsequent protocols and agreements including the paris agreement this is relevant because since the waiting period for the unfccc expired in only a one year notification is necessary so the us could have withdrawn from both the unfccc and the paris agreement after only one year instead of three additionally these liberal idiots do not understand that chinas fleet of new coal power plants would make it virtually impossible to meet the goals in the deal do these people think that india and china actually give two shits they want to develop their economy and lift people out of poverty they will use fossil fuels to do so no amount of liberal whining will make them change their minds zoning and regulations  that doesnt mean we need or want section housing it will be interesting bc the invasion of nonwhites of all stripes has been keeping the housing prices high californias population is actually decreasing now everyone likes fishing but you gotta be kidding me for this useless inch fish white liberals care more about this than their fellow white productive peers its some sort of beastiality cuckholding that is odd even for them environmental regulations aimed at protecting a inchlong fish the endangered delta smelt have required the massive state and federal pumps near tracy to reduce pumping rates by nearly half of their full limit sharply curbing the amount of water that can be saved for farms and cities to the south the move has angered central valley politicians of both parties along with agricultural leaders who have been arguing for many months that someone must help farmers suffering terribly during the drought now they are frustrated that the state department of water resources and the federal bureau of reclamation arent capturing more water amid the record rainfall maybe the government doesnt know what they are doing
this is fucking hilarious california wont even be there in give it the next couple years the whole goddamn still be in the ocean so i dont even know why they made this fucking video in the first place
too many wine grapes
lets see this video be wrong af in
the coming us fiscal crisis will be a far greater concern overall we wont have the money to address any of this when we are in default
then go to bed at night and stop heating up the atmosphere with street lights duhhh lightheat duhhh
these progressive politicians in sf have certainly progressively screwd and destroyed this once world class city
drugs be a bigger problem for ya
and fear tactics go build more mansions
what a funny poeple there in america global warming dint excist years ago and hear them now yes america you are the fault for it thanks again
i have the perfect solution to the climate problem but nobody cares all i need is a grant
bye bye to your year round nice weather
climate engineering aka climate change
global weather catastrophe predictions the world has been chilling sharply for about years ecologist kenneth watt said in if present trends continue the world will be about degrees colder for the global mean temperature in but degrees colder in the year this is about twice what it would take to put us into an ice age
advocates of global warmingclimate change predictions that did not happen dire famine by everyone will disappear in a cloud of blue steam by ice age by america subject to water rationing by and food rationing by new ice age coming in increase in regional drought in s ocean levels will rise from one to six feet maldives completely under water in years rising seas to obliterate nations by children wont know what snow is famine in years al gore warns of icefree arctic by arctic will be icefree by prince charles says only years to save the planet al gore polar ice cap may disappear by summer prof peter wadhams icefree arctic in years french foreign minister laurent fabius days to avoid climate chaos and al gore john kerry joe biden bernie sanders and their understudy greta how dare u thunberg are still in this climate change hoax promoted by the aristocracy of europe led by king charles iii this climate change hoax appears to be a psyop designed to control governments and the people of this world
its an agenda and a lot are waking up too it

how many climate predictions have to be flat wrong before yall stop making these things
ha theyll destroy cali before you ever fix anything how do you change a poverty mindset to a helping and caring one not being of greed i dont want understand any of you anyways
what climate change r
there used to be jungles in antarctica lets burn all that fossil fuel and get the jungles growing
the bay area has far greater problems that warming could ever bring
milencovich cycles periodic ice age periodic mass extinction duh
oh no they didnt insert the picture of the day the sun didnt happen omg that was one of the unbelievable and unsettling moments in my life nothing can prepare you for darkness that tells you its in the morning but the clocks say noon the silence of the animals was the worst im going to say that they may not be exactly correct i think that perhaps instead of their projections these strange little micro climates will instead become more humid and warm we will be seeing more rain in the summer from the pineapple express and the water level may rise to where the inland seas return my fear is that we lose our karl completely and the fog is our secret weapon against the brutal heat that occurs through the rabbit hole caldecott tunnel it has always astonished me how different the temperature is from one side to the other i once clocked the difference at degrees f from one side to the other water levels will be all the way back to pre human times honestly this is our fate as we dug up the intentionally buried dead bodies of all life from dinosaur times and then we set it on fire essentially cremating it the carbon and methane in the atmosphere is simply the ghosts of these disturbed spirits that our earth intelligently had sealed away far beneath the bedrock we have arrogantly released these and now we are beginning to see the return of the environments of the deep past that we and all other species are just not adapted for nature will never end but we just might and maybe thats a built in obsolescence that nature will utilize
you have no clue so keep the fear ignorance behind the closed church doors
the government is not taxing enough
yeah just like england was supposed to be underwater by the year how many times will you mugs fall for the same trick
ever heard of geoengineering
the water levels have not changed more lies
really such sensationalism i am a senior citizen and have lived in different states and have known very cold winters in fla and in ga the climate changes every season we have had summers in ga and fla with drought and this year the ponds are full and we have had a beautiful spring with mild days and cool nights it was the same last year people have been affected by storms however there are more people and they live closer together and build where they should not build i remember as a child seeing heat waves coming up from the sidewalks the environmentalist are fear monguls who throw away tons of plastic water bottles in the trash out their car windows and in our streams and oceans while they tell us we should drive electric cars and eat bugs instead of meat because they say cows produce gas most of these people have not lived in more than one or two states they hire people to spray their homes and lawns with weed killer and bug killer which also kills good bugs and good plant life which also gets into our food and water supply there is a bug spray for killing spiders spiders eat bad bugs like mosquitos etc but lets kill spiders frogs lizards and all the other good insects animals fish and birds i think we need to realize that god the creator made the world and all things in the world including man to live move and have its being in a balanced and harmonious way man thinks he can do better with the world than god he cant do you like eating genetically altered fruits and vegetables i dont they are not better or healthier stop playing god summers are hot some more than others same with fall winter and spring god is in charge but man creates havoc trying to outdo god man cant do better
climate extremes are raging and there is no reversal we must reduce significantly co emissions
patents on weather manipulation
move thats what the romans and past civilizations did this is not new
lies lies lies its all a scam especially when bill dr evil gates is involved
and tell us to eat bugs
for me climate change is one season to the next not anyones prediction of what is to come i have lived years and that is all i need to know
to major next pandemic
why do tax payers have to pay so you can live next to the ocean this should be state funded only you want to live in paradise then you pay for it totally against helping sf get ready for flooding wouldnt want your homeless population sleeping in flood water everyone living in potential disaster areas im sorry i do not want to pay for your repair costs anymore to me thats a personal choice no one forced you to live next to the ocean were you know  well there is the potential of losing your home you dont want to be flooded move inland stay away from rivers rant off
the driving laws need to change you should need a reason to be driving it will also help people getting fat also wine doesnt need to be made
why are they talking about paradise its literally nowhere near the bay area its like hours away
jesus is coming back
my kitchen temp changes all the time fake science
global warming catastrophe prediction brown said that entire nations could be wiped off the face of the earth by rising sea levels if global warming is not reversed by the year coastal flooding and crop failures would create an exodus of ecorefugees threatening political chaos said brown director of the new york office of the u n environment program
fake news being fake news
its easy to make projections for the year with no chance of being held accountable for being totally wrong
very poorly done scifi
nobody talk about space weather look up magnetic pole shift learn the truth
based on no real facts you cant calculate that by the sea will be feet higher also bay area is definitely nothing like the mediterranean climate
hilarious we have climate protesters ignoring nuclear war with russia
chaos theory called said try gamblers anonymous if you know th e future
there will be no when is people going to wake up
this is not true even the host is did not know what happening
mediterranean climate is not defined by mild wet winters mild winters yes but dry only fall and spring are to some extent rainy seasons
i am hearing way too much wishful planning and thinking the global weather doesnt respond well to human climate predictions weve all seen this happen before so its not on the politicians to act but the average joe has to find the courage find his or hers spine and get involved with citizens climate activist bc they will say to all of us we had it all wrong when disaster strikes and it will be our own doing the time to act is now before yesterday gets here
false false false
global cooling weather prediction in c c wallen of the world meteorological organization said that the cooling since has been large enough and consistent enough that it will not soon be reversed scientist nigel calder wrote that the threat of a new ice age must now stand alongside nuclear war as a likely source of wholesale death and misery for mankind
earthquake will destroy the bay area
ive never heard so much nonsense in such a short time
the cliamte is rather meh in the winter for norcal i much prefer houstons warm and humid climate especially in winter and spring
desalination with cheap clean nuclear duh
lol climate change no such thing bud
i keep hearing republicans say we cant do anything about climate change because it would be bad for the economy now im not an economics expert but im pretty sure the end of human civilization would be pretty bad for the economy
mother nature its on now bitches
its not a political issue whether or not it is happening because it is it is a political issue as to who will deal with it that is either you do something or you dont the second option is reprehensible the separation from cognitive process so often displayed that is the wedge a happy fantasy or dealing with the problem the easy surrender or the fight for humanitys future
the humanity as a whole should do something about this this is not about partisanship or ideology its about the survival of humanity countries should be obligated to act
the article did not say civilization will end by it said end of civilization will start in there is a difference nevertheless it is a huge alarm
saying i told you so is not going to be very satisfying
coal and oil were good for helping the world reach an advanced level of society but we did not use logic and our advancement to obtain cleaner more efficient energy sources weve already passed some tipping points in the late s anyone that can read a graph can see were heading in the wrong direction
lol drag them out into the streets and have a political conversation with them
population reduction would be a good solution to climate change
thank you for mentioning the meat industry well done rarely mentioned
you have to realize we are dealing with a segment of the population which is hoping for the return of jesus and all that will bring including the end of the world so everything that can happen to hasten the second coming is good in their eyes
well i guess we better enjoy our time countdown years
the earth needs to rid itself of the human infection
no kids for me because of this how could i possibly bring anyone into this world with this future to look forward to im actually happy that humans are on their way out its the best thing that could happen to the planet since were the worst thing to have ever happened to it evolution please dont be so ghastly stupid again
this is the best news ive heard in a very long time
hes wearing a star wars t shirt believe me everyone he can be trusted
politicians should face this challenge now really now instead of thinking only about their money and their power
this is why it is so frustrating to see so many conservatives saying it is just politics when reasonable people are getting upset after they deny the facts
go prince charles i mean i knew itd be completely futile but good on ya
the simple fact is most people dont get it until it affects them personally or their loved ones but by then it may be to late
the biggest hurdle is the ignorant technooptimism that nearly everyone suffers from which is manifested in the completely unsubstantiated delusion that someone somewhere is working on a solution to the inevitable ecological collapse and that they have the means to solve it well the truth is that nobody is working on any solution and that there is no technology that can save us from this problem predominantly because technology caused this problem civilization is inherently unsustainable because its foundation agriculture is inherently unsustainable and the proof of which can be seen in the undeniable fact that literally every civilization since the emergence of agriculture years ago has collapsed predominantly due to environmental destruction the near middle east used to have thick cedar forests everywhere thats why the lebanese flag has two of them on it and in lest than years the very first farmers turned it into a desert and that was with zero technology petrichemicals and was basically the most organic farming possible in the present we use every technology at our disposal and our soil is basically inert dead matter that we spray petroleum products on as if it were a sponge and thereby agriculture has become even less sustainable its only hubris and ignorance that makes the world at present believe it somehow wont happen to us but it will a recent un report concluded that even with a level of technological development completely unrealistic and even with a global will to solve the problem we have yet to see its impossible and thats also because that it doesnt matter how efficient new technology is or ilhow strict pollution rules are when you add new factories every day and the world is predicated upon a capitalist system of infinite expansion its going to outstrip the finite resources now civilization has been around for years and has yet to produce a single sustainable model or life way contrast that to our huntergatherer ancestors who were able to live completely sustainable for years and it becomes evidently clear that there is nothing of redeemable value created by civilization and technology if it cant even keep us alive or at least stop killing everything
ive been reading a series of short stories establishing the back story to phoenix point where the the big bad is a metaphor for global warming and often the characters hate politicians more than the alien mutant eldritch crab people at first the idea that a politician would accelerate the end of human civilization in order to maintain the power relations that theyre used to seemed fantastical then merely improbable now i mostly just feel dread
you know id rather have a job than have a planet i can live on whos with me
there is a common reason that there are refugee crises in syria africa central america and others it is embodied in the phrase food wont grow here anymore the climate disaster is here and is happening now
hey as long as it triggers the libs sargon of akadd
just a reminder that eating animals also contributes to climate change especially cows
uh is more like it the exponential change in climate has just begun and will accelerate quickly its too late
same mentality as oh i have this weird bump that hurts nah im not going to the doctor must be fine in a few weeks
hail mother nature shame on thou humans for thine greed for ye shall witness the wrath of mother nature and woe be upon those who live a life of pleasure and hedonism for their days are numbered and no one shall be spared save the elect that mother nature has called to protect her and live in harmony with the beasts of the earth
its all damage control from here on people
finally this human plague has a close end
i wont even be done paying my student loans time to take more loans then
ill be years old in well that sucks
imagine living in the greatest time to be alive in human history with unmatched prosperity opportunity and wellness and thinking a trace gas is going to make the planet uninhabitable in our lifetime how did we get here its just sad
talk about a hard pill to swallow
the amazon forest is on fire right now all hope is lost
you missed a major part of it the lose of land not only will people start to flee those areas but it is hard to go back there after this no farms no mines no factories no homes at some point there is a limit to how much the planet can maintain of us
i hate to be the guy to point out that climate change is not an existential crisis by the description given in this video its more like an apocalyptic crisis
keep sending the right message
its already too late to avoid c warming by we can work towards avoiding c warming by
i purpose that those who survive climate change should build a giant statue entitled to our ancestors those who chose to do nothing the statue should just be a foot tall man giving the middle finger
money wont matter when we are all dead
i keep thinking this isnt even two full generations away anymore the children born or later will only have a deathworld to bring their children into
bruh im and i have a future i dont want to go out like that not like that man
grant shepherd wrote those that bash trump and want to drag those into the street they disagree with like david wants to fail to realize that other countries do exactly the same thing trump does no shitforbrains trump pulling america out of the paris accords made us the only country to do so this dude is a fuckin genius
why isnt anyone talking about the benefits of having less humans on the earth not saying a mass extinction event would be ideal but a slow transition in to having generations die off while less are being born
people around the world live in different climates different altitudes and in different environments two degrees will not extinct humans degrees will
a repeat of the carrington event of would do it quite literally overnight no need for climate change high tech civilization would be severely crippled if not outright destroyed while the planet would barely notice
polar caps are melting faster than they thought can you imagine all the crop loss from weather events drought and flooding
trump doesnt give a  about anything but himself and too dumb to educate about anything
ill be surprised if things dont go south well before about the time everybody realizes that this  is real people will start getting hysterical and we will eat each other literally
truckee tahoe triathlon wrote i was alive in when the world was going to end in years because of global warming i was alive in when gore said we had years to save the world haha you cant always say the world is going to end and be wrong no one should believe you guys now no one sports fans do you think this guy ran maybe one too many races without gatorade
there is one test i use to determine if someone is truly concerned about climate change i ask them do they support nuclear power i dont take them seriously if they say no france went basically carbonfree in electricity in years from the point when they started the world could do the same
ill be in i should talk to my future husband children about climate change before then
just for information in germany we saw tornados only in usmovies in the last years it starts with tornados in middleeurope and every year we have more and more
from my understanding we are well past the tipping points it is very unlikely we can prevent some form of a global extinction of some scale without total dedication of the human race the problem will resolve itself if we can start to mitigate the negatives effects today like buy an electric car and power your homebusiness from clean sources wind geothermal solar fissionfusion hydro just those two steps would be enough to prevent a mass extinction from the cloudless desert scenario viable for the next year assuming that happens we do have gmos for the new environment to come so crops that can crow in the new climate are already ready if we dont we end up in one of two scenarios cloudless desert where all large land animals die off and most of the vegetation globally so sea life desert plants in the previous tropic zones and bugs on land this should start in about years from now a slow slide as the planet mostly no longer creates clouds planet wide is projected about years out or so or carbon dioxide toxicity levels reach past tolerable levels the old and infants would go first and quickly and the rest would follow a few weeks or months later this would be the sudden but most complete die out we were sitting at ppm and we are at ppm today once it reaches around ppm we will see the mass die out so at pace we will get there by the debate is really which will happen first and if instead of years it more like yearsdue human intervention but there is not a debate going on as to if it will happen years later everything would return to normal as sea life flushes and returns the planet to normal land animals returning and supporting larger size and vegetation would again spread across the earth
the biggest scare for me were the siberian heatwave summer major release of methane the northwest american heatwave and drought breaking old records by a huge margin and the record early heat in northwest india and pakistan in april what will we see this summer
religion convinces people that life on earth is bad and only through death do you live eternally in bliss to the extent that most people believe this they are enforcing their deathwish on the rest of mankind our only hope may be there is a yahweh type god who takes all the true believers away at once
jesus christ dude i need some goddamn therapy after this episode im only my kids are gonna grow up in a world where theyre suckin on bloodpacks to stay alive and  like that
simple just stop listening obeying and working for them stop talking get off your butt and cut your dependence on big business big government and the monetary economy place your entire critical lifesupport system under your control move to the country set up an offgrid homestead learn how to be selfsufficient and resilient this lifestyle change takes time do it today while you still can participate in the monetary economy with a right livelihood business but do not allow yourself to be dependent upon the monetary economy for your survival the purpose of this dependency is control the purpose of cities is control if you are dependent and allow external providers to control your critical lifesupport system they control you they own you
the world and universe would be better off without us anyway
who is here in and seeing that global warming is very much real and looking more and more like it just might take us all out
greenland alone is losing km of ice every year years ago it was about km interpolate that years further today this corresponds to the amount of water from four niagara falls flowing into the north atlantic
limits to growth is real too and just as catastrophic for humanity
climate change is a problem for us not reading the article and talking about the article is a problem for journalism you analyze football tactics without ever seeing the game
anything that can happen will happen the earth is fucked
were fucked if we get him again in
pheraps is too soon but i cant understand how someone can joke about it we are destroying our planet the world all around us is beautiful and we want to change it why for a moment be serious for a moment think about it for a moment love the world that is in front of you
complains about climate change mentions his children uh
dont play with me the end of humanity pinky promise me
hurry up with the fucking end of the world already
still funny to see davids channel drastically charge left while hes away
is a bit generous considering how fucked up  is right now id say more like
densal grant wrote im from up north the air is clear and fresh reality doesnt work that way bubbles there are no atmospheric fences you seriously need to crack a science book on second thought forget the science book and first concentrate on getting that g e d then you can start working on the harder stuff like thinking this dude is a fuckin genius
and how is it than that one side aims to not solve it and the other side aims to try to solve it in the least efficient way possible that has been proven to not work people have become mad
now in we are have record breaking temperature every year
lets not forget the nuclear waste stored in greenland thanks to the us army during the cold war the containers arent even sealed properly if they fall into the ocean youll have all manner of radio nuclieds spreading everywhere
a day will come in our lifetime where there is no more air to breathe we will all die gasping
end of human civilization did it ever begin
sir these politicians are under the control of satan but dont worry god almighty has a plan
another reason to be antinatalist and stop the cycle of suffering
ive been thinking for awhile now that human existence will be having a bottle neck in the next few decades drastic measures will have to result in drastic results we have been working on our drastic measures since the steamboat
did you know it the s there was a consensus that the world was cooling
the poor will all die by and the rich will be on their space colonies under the leadership of lord bezos lol
global warming is a hoax donald trump
bah i watch this channel for david and his level headed thoughts dont really like watching this guy that much
what ever you do dont have babies
the only thing that will change in is the music
given near perfect historic correlation and sound physics to expect causation between energy consumption and wealth more specifically us mw and given over of energy comes from burning carbon including ancient oil coal gas old wood and recent biomass and the remaining of energy requires burning carbon for materials construction maintenance and energy distribution for example cement from natural gas steel from coal and diesel machines to mine and transport the concrete steel and uranium required to build and operate hydroelectric dams and nuclear plants and given wind and solar cant scale up to replace tw of burning carbon which for comparison is billion watt bulbs about per person because of low power density intermittency and high storage cost and because wind and solar requires burning carbon for materials construction maintenance and energy distribution for example concrete steel copper glass silicon and composites and diesel trucks to transport install and maintain the equipment and diesel machines to build and maintain the access roads and because wind and solar equipment wears out and must be replaced after years when there will be little remaining oil to do so and given that most do not understand the tight dependencies between burning carbon to create the wealth we enjoy and want more of nor burning carbon to make the nitrogen fertilizer our food requires nor burning carbon to pump the water we drink and irrigate crops with nor burning carbon for tractors and combines that permit us to specialize nor burning carbon to transport everything we depend on to survive nor burning carbon to make the concrete steel and glass we live in nor burning carbon for the vacations recreation and internet we enjoy nor burning carbon and population growth from to billion nor burning carbon and climate change that threatens our children nor burning carbon and sea level rise that threatens many cities nor burning carbon and aerosols that mask c additional warming nor burning carbon and ocean acidification that is killing coral reefs etc nor burning carbon and the sixth great extinction nor burning carbon and the collapse of fisheries nor burning carbon and rising ground level ozone that is killing trees and given that most are not aware of or preparing for the coming shitstorm caused by an energy price high enough to cover extraction costs that are rising per year due to depleting lowcost reserves is an energy price too high to permit economic growth and without growth debt defaults causing a depression so we conjure growth with new money created out of thin air by increasing debt which is a useful trick when real growth is possible but a deadly trick when there are limits to growth because it is equivalent to eating seed corn and this debt is exploding to unprecedented levels worldwide because it now takes more than of debt for of growth with total debt about us trillion triple that in forcing central banks to print money to keep interest rates low interest is not normal as all grownups know and this free money has created an illusion of oil abundance because fracking companies can operate despite losing money meaning much oil will disappear when interest rates rise and this free money has created bubbles of unprecedented size in stocks bonds real estate education healthcare etc that must eventually burst and revert through their mean hurting even the innocents who did not participate thus printing money will someday cause suffering and social unrest via a deflationary or hyperinflationary monetary collapse depending on how politicians respond from a much higher and harmful elevation than it needed to be because there is no such thing as a free lunch and we chose not to acknowledge limits and to live within our means despite being warned of the dangers since at least even though our means compared to most of history are excellent for example a poor canadian lives better than a pharaoh with our real wealth of net energy per person falling so falls our productivity because everything we do uses energy for example barrel of oil does years of manual labor so of oil replaces of minimum wages and we burn about billion barrels of oil per year meaning each of our billion is helped by energy slaves plus a similar number from coal gas hydro and nuclear and because weve already captured most efficiencies so falls our real incomes for all except the upper which profit from money printing and in addition to using debt the further masked declining real incomes by lowering the cost and price of manufactured items by consolidating shopping at walmart and amazon and by moving good paying manufacturing jobs to poorer countries which made us more vulnerable to supply chain disruptions because everything we need is now made elsewhere and because trucks trains and ships all burn diesel oil and cannot practically be made to run on anything else and this loss of good jobs further lowered incomes making citizens angry for example brexit and trump and if citizens continue to not understand the cause of decline nor the plentiful reasons to be thankful they may someday support a despot like hitler who was supported because of harm from weimar money printing and who blamed other tribes and promised war for gain but unlike past wars that rewarded victors with booty for example the us empire and its reserve currency the next war will return few rewards to the victor because weve already burned most of the good booty and well burn a lot more waging war and well risk annihilation with nuclear weapons that a desperate country without oil and hope may use so its therefore a really good idea for citizens to understand that geology biology and thermodynamics caused our predicament so citizens cant be persuaded to blame another person or tribe and so citizens see the blessing for their children of burning less carbon because a c rise caused the climate problems weve already experienced and another c rise is baked in no matter what we do because co passed ppm and is still rising meaning our great great great great grandchildren already have to contend with at least meters of sea level rise and were on a catastrophic path to another c rise or more meaning most humans in a few generations will not survive unless we soon mostly stop burning carbon which depletion will force anyway unfortunately too late and so citizens see the wisdom of using some remaining carbon wealth to build a softer landing zone in preparation for a world with local food and local economies and much less energy wealth complexity and population and given that our culture leaders and news focus almost exclusively on gdp growth which as weve seen is actually growth in burning carbon and given our need for constant reinforcement to fight our human tendency to deny unpleasant realities which blocks awareness discussion and action on every issue that matters for example climate change peak oil and overpopulation all symptoms of overshoot which the green party doesnt even mention we should seize a simple public education opportunity by renaming gdp gross domestic product to gdb gross domestic burn so every time we discuss the economy we worship we are reminded how fortunate we are to be alive on an extraordinarily rare and beautiful planet with extraordinarily rare and beautiful eukaryotic life with an extraordinarily rare and intelligent brain during the brief year period out of billion with abundant burning carbon and the many reasons for thankfulness and temperance
dont worry before that happens the plastic soup will destroy most of life
starting in not by
call me an optimist but i think were about to see what were made of well be ok itll get rough but well use our unique problem solving minds and overcome this weve faced big challenges before now with a lot less by way of resources knowledge skills infrastructure im tipping massive nuclear roll out desalination possibly atmos cleaning tech just around the corner

doug acclaim software wrote i write as a scientist who has specialized in the study of atmospheric and subterrestrial physics your comment is proof that you chose the wrong field of study and your appeal to authority has failed but i hear walmart has openings in the toy section for people like you who imagine themselves geniuses just tryin to help the guy
how come no one of talking about the ice age
to save ourselves we just have to give more power to the banks and corporations who for some reason seem to back so many of the organizations
yeah right more like positive feedbacks have already kicked in and we are fucked time is really short
where is the evidence we have not moved past the tipping point at what point was it too late for the titanic it was certainly long before anyone on the titanic including the captain realized it
i have a feeling that well just have thanos those billion people fast and efficiently to preserve order and our stability
they wont have any profits once their factories are destroyed then theyll realize how bad they ducked up maybe
theres only about percent of the people that think its a problem everybody else thinks it is a conspiracy or a hoax
will be roughly when the oil runs out and not the end of the world and if anyone is that interested get on to london busses and taxis china tokyo rome and india where the main culprits are im from up north the air is clear and fresh
he predicted dont look up
i think climate change is important but its not gonna end human civilization in years thats really hard to believe
the abc news link now has page unavailable
is it really worth living if we cant eat meat or have eat insects or take the bus
if we could only be so lucky
but g is more important thing youve expressed yourself the way i think i would do it on the video we all have to stand up now or never we have to change our minds by using scientific environmental knowledge
individuals and corporations alike wont change until it is way to late the way i see it we better get some type of energy source viable to replace fossil fuels as fast as possible the one that seems to look most hopeful to me is fusion energy
watch cowspiracy go vegan
i do not know the validity of this but it has been said the sir issac newton andor nostradamus was quoted as having said that the world will end before although i do believe he used bible and theological ideas in combination with science for this predicition of course you take in account he attempted to turn lead into gold you know before they discovered nuclear transmutation not always spot on
good thing ill be gone before that ever happens
trump is hes not going to be around then
funny how some crazy conspiracy theorists get banned while some are not

so stop saving for retirement max out my credit cards
agriculture and domestication of animals is the original sin jesus preached to repent which translate as turn around or change hunter and gather societies are pretty much egalitarian but agricultural societies authoritarian and herding societies tend to be warfaring both rely on wealth inequality or class and both separate themselves from the natural world the sins of our anscestors have brought us here the sixth great extinction
the sky is falling the sky is falling we need more carbon taxes al gore is running low on funds
youre not helping the cause by saying click baity things like civilization might end in due to climate change you sound like the guy on the street with the sign saying the end is near there are actual concerns with climate change that we should address the more you cry wolf with the end of the world stuff the less people will take the legitimate concerns seriously oh and i tried to click on the link to find what evidence there was for the end of civilization and it is a broken link
theres no such thing as the term human

there you go altright this is your moment huh you dont understand you have been preparing for this your whooole life you know dont you save western civilisation
as trump orders bigmacs
read the same article in about whats coming in or thereabouts
i recall them saying the same thing in aoc said years a few months ago and now its
drought in the amazon the amazon dubbed by the scientific community as the lungs of the planet
read alex epstein hear both sides hes a great mind
omg he went from talking to screaming back to talking  chill out
in a very weird way im happy about this because it will be a very good driver for humanity going post biological
there is snow right now in antarctic thus global warming is not real check mate
lol the migration period duringfollowing the roman collapse
coldest wettest winter in us history was cas three snowiest years on record have all been since meanwhile you rubes are worried about it getting warmer if you want to save the environment quit supporting industrial agriculture and start growing some of your own food the climate is changing but it aint getting warmer the cooler climate is going to affect crop production and lead to higher food prices and eventually terrible famine the danish scientist hans svensmark has been predicting climate based solar activity since the early s the government has been pushing this global warming scare since the s wheres the predicted sea level rise where are the higher temperatures the only way they can show warming is by modifying the data to erase the tremendous warming that occurred during the s there were several years with heatwaves that saw temperatures above in the midwest this year because of flooding millions of heads of cattle died and the yield for crops is going to be lower the media is screaming for you to look left and worry about it getting too hot while the real threat is coming from the complete opposite direction dont be a brainwashed zombie following the corporate media listen to scientists from both sides consensus is crap evaluate their arguments and see what makes more sense coldest and wettest octmay on record
i hear him whining but i dont hear any solutions how do you fix it and keep everyone fed will new technologies like fusion and carbon scrubbers correct this issue
well we had a good run lol lets make sure we leave a note tho so the next intelligent specie might not repeat our mistakes
thought it was years
this is completely false this is a hyperbolic article there have been no claims by actual scientific research to support the suggested claim
last person to evacuate earth please make sure you turn off the power lights
this is so scary it reminds me of my childhood in the s with the cold war threat i really feel for our children
i have really bad anxiety and climate change has been something that triggers my anxiety i hope we can fix this before its too late
we all learn about global warming every year starting in our school days heard news about it but this video is very different based on same topic always love your creativity bro lastly thank you may our earth live long
basically we are fucked and it is too late to fix it should have paid more attention to those scientists years ago
mate its and several things from these are happening today
if the global warming wont stop it might become venus in the long long future
prices of crops are double of what they were decades ago more like months ago and thatsjust one war obstructing export and a couple of heatwaves and drought periods around the globe seems like well be paying times as much for food as were doing today thee big thing of climate change will be food shortage even more than heat
not the citizens fault ask the government destroy their plans argue with them im not scared of death when we all die its their fault god is coming all the gods and lords are mad at us
so we are dead in
i will be years old then its really upsetting
you are inventive can you complete upper limb please
this almost made my couzin cry
gee this sounds like now
everywhere we listen about this topic and so many plans too to resolve this but waiting when ill be able to see the planet free from global warming
creativesociety globalcrisis time truth
its cute that you think there will be anybody let alone civilization around in
which software you used name plz
ill be approaching retirement age ya i am not sure it looks all that glamorous

plant more trees dont support china india or us only for food
where did you get the world population being billion
dont forget about viruses etc locked up in the melting ice
years of failed climate predictions
lmao this is such a joke
im brand new to the solar industry i can definitely say from a sales reps point of view there is nothing like it for helping homeowners you think those government stimulus checks were great wait until you try the government solar program solar energy and electric cars are the two biggest impacts you can have on co in the air from what i have seen so far one average home can eliminate tons of co click on me for contact info if you would like to look into it with me

everyone thinks this is too optimistic but i feel like of this will come true by technology is already moving at an incredible speed faster than ever before its just not what general conversations are about we cant comprehend this type of speed in tech but im confident all of what was said is possible in years
the one thing i would say is i dont think foldable screens will be used too much i think it will go towards smart glasses replacing phones rather than foldable screens
why is the music always so epic haha
were going to have to produce a lot more electricity to make even one of these things a reality even if the tech exists the nuclear reactors mentioned would be absolutely needed
even if half of what is said becomes real it will be a major game changer
technology is moving incredibly quick and as soon as quantam computing becomes widely used technology will advance at a rate that is hard for us to comprehend but that being said having even of this by are very very optimistic no doubt that majority of the technology advancements mentioned here are already in an advanced stage but to have these technologies ready available and accessible at a consumer level even by you will need to have of the population on this planet have the best interest of humanity as a priority which includes oil and petrochemical companies pharmaceutical companies energy companies and governments and unfortunately greed and corruption will make sure that many of these technologies dont become widespread accessible even by but that is just my opinion
youd better do future videos for etc i love these videos because it just shows how exciting the future really can be
i think the quantum internet is the only way to talk across the milky way galaxy since quantum entangelment is instant
i believe this is more like
most people say this is way too optimistic but honestly i believe at least of this will be reality by tech isnt just evolving its accelerating at a pace most people arent even aware of were seeing breakthroughs weekly sometimes daily but because its not part of everyday conversations most cant grasp just how fast things are moving at tomorrowcoded we dive into the future most still think is fiction and from everything ive seen im confident that the world were imagining for is already being built right now
i find this video very helpful thank you
agi will be here in i cant wait to get my own ai robot
while i appreciate the enthusiasm theres no way that thumbnail is the world in
once the quantum era arrives technology will speed up fast
i learned so much in minutes
i had to laugh a commercial interrupted your commercial i guess we need an a i to fix that
in this video could have been made but would have said by in the last years we have lept ahead cutting years off previous predictions truly crazy scary uncertain times the world is entering and at ever increasing pace
your logic is undeniable
with voyagers and being billions of miles away where signals take hours having quantum ai on future voyagers will be a mind boggling upgrade since itll be able to think for itself and make better decisions than humans also itll eliminate many commands needed thus saving many hours since itll be autonomous and lead to discoveries in the cosmos that voyagers and simply cannot do
this will be so amazing
the crazy thing about it is ironman suit will be realistic and possible
some lofty expectations for yrs from now
whats the use of extended life spans when jobs are obliterated along with self esteem
just so were all aware is years away this is ambitious even with the speed tech is evolving
there are researchers who have already realized that beyond the material frequency spectrum is a field that they may call the zero point field or other names but it is a field that has unlimited energy what scientists are beginning to realize is that the current vision where everything is seen as separate objects existing in a spatial dimension is unrealistic there are no separate objects because every object you see on earth or in the material universe is actually manifested out of the field it is a densification of the field where the unlimited energy of the field has taken on a finite form it is a temporary form but it can be sustained over time it is of course the same with energy there are scientists who have already conducted experiments that show that you can extract energy directly from the field and use it for practical purposes on earth they have been ridiculed and put down they have had their research grants taken away and they have been labeled as kooks
sad that im going to hit the club before ive partied too hard
so in people will be glued to self generated movies on their phones while their virtual clones talk to each other serious concern not sarcasm
woooow i love the content thanks
ah h ll no thats too creepy but then again i would like a clone to go to work for me
its amazing technology is growing stronger and stronger
great idea for a video watched it to completion but im telling you this mark my words barely is going to be feasible by and i dont think even half of this will be achieved by by maybe will be reality
ai and superfast quantum computing will fundamentally change life in ways we cannot even imagine
the vibe is perfect
the whole cloning thing sound so depressing
so were going to have clones to record our lives to watch later instead of just living our actual lives what the  are we even doing
you explained it perfectly
is already happening today
the way my lifes going hopefully print me a new liver
zettascale supercomputers could enable the creation of a virtual cell allowing for atomistic simulations of the human bodymodeling trillions of atoms in detail
its really cute that he thinks we will still use displays
yall wanna know something diamonium batteries diamonium storage or crystallinebit based systems
the year thats really really close
nice amazing dont skip ads
the ghost is already in the shell
the reality of the world is that by the time you see it yourself its probably already atleast a decade old atleast
no orion augemantions with mjolnir mark vi gen ll mention is despicable
i think conversational agi is here as well we dont have mobility agi as in robotics quite yet but id say by as well
the same thing they said about g
people saying this is optimistic when we are months away of having agi not years and we already had narrow asi recently agi maybe by the end of this year asi maybe before the progress could be so much greater
this is pretty accurate in my opinion
quantum computing in how much you want to bet
i personally hope we see advancements in gene editing and stem cell therapies soon my father recently lost most vision in his right eye from glaucoma and it would be incredible if i could restore his vision to normal levels
why have i never heard anything about the mini transferable reactors energy producers this is beyond superior next level technology
so finally the world will be an amazing place ha
probably not for me i would rather have a real woman that i can hold and love
all drive and development of personal power autonomy no desire or development of personal responsibility tedd kaszinsky was and will be proven right of this has even began to ememrge in the uk its maniacal dream thats all
given its current state its doubtful that a quantum computer could be used for cloud storage
now youre remaking your old videos wow
omg i think it will great future
that is when g comes out
it all comes down to when we hit agi and the models being able to self develop when that happens agi goes to asi in lightning speed and asi will be eons more advanced than us if we are still around we could go from us currently to a type civilization in a decade
very well and reality
this would all be great if we had world peace and no governmentpolitical corruption
by ill be like not even turning yet
id be highly surprised if most of this is available and functional in the next five years
this video was a lot of happy talk that ive been promised for the last years especially when it comes to healthcare and cures for cancer lets get one thing straight under a socialized medical system the only incentive that governments have is to see you die as soon as possible the last thing a socialist government is going to want to do is cure your cancer so they have to keep paying your government pensionsocial security for decades longer maybe the elites will get those cures but definitely not us plebstax serfs
i wanna live in a cyberpunk city not the pollution or chance of death just the way it looks like that would be cool as hell plus if you look at it they have more nature in night city then we do in our cities anyways
i have one question if carbonation is so dangerous to the human society why do we use it i know we use it to breath and all but just why though
remember those people who were making fun of will smith spaghetti video then in under a year the ai videos got very advanced and will continue to do so
aint no way digital clones cure to cancer laptop screens folding up like paper i just dont see it not in years
overall acoustics could use help
yesssssssssss its really our future
airobots increases global output x making things so much cheaper and allowing for ubi universal basic income check out the world economic forums agenda own nothing but be happy crypto will be a big factor as well with new billionaires and trillionaires all of these industries will be well funded we are stepping closer each day
i will wait until and see if it will actually happen
wer soll das alles bezahlen neue organe fr milliardre kein problem aber was passiert mit rentnern ohne ersparnissen welches land kann sich die knstlichen bume leisten und welche jobs bleiben den menschen wenn die ki alles macht

wonder if we will ever get a high speed railway in ca by
i think we will live same as now big changes will be when robots will come to our world
which part of the planet not in years it will be patchy starting with the rich then some trickle downwards its great future dream though
the future has already come
you seem to have completely forgotten the constraints and limitations of our capitalistic economic system
interactive live qas strengthen loyalty
maybe by s a lot of this stuff is in development and will need to be made out to scale so at best
this kinda assumes corporate greed allows these inventions to be easily accessible
but i will be in my late s by
great talk thank you
bro please make auto dubbed video in hindi love from india
the future isnt coming its already unfolding by the technologies we once called science fiction will shape daily life in ways we can barely imagine the question is are we evolving as fast as our inventions
this nonsense is designed to manipulate peoples hopes for the future it is the typical abundance propaganda that lulls the public into allowing corporations to take control over literally everything the only way that theres even a future past is to reject this alltech fantasy embrace degrowth as a future economic model and completely focus on ecological sciences to deal with the impending famines and droughts
this like my th comment but whatever i dont like the hypersonic missiles i think they should just throw the newest robots and see who wins the one that wins gets the scraps and whats left
people from the year please let me know if any of this came true
hypermarket supermarket mini market money debet dollar
no chance this happens by quantum tech isnt close to the levels you have suggested in the video agi certainly isnt a guarantee anytime soon if it does happen there wont be any more jobs left as you suggested in the video
just make sure your bot doesnt evolve on u
too optimistic in this reality will  worse than
they already have unitree robot dogs walking with human masters inside malls parks etc
how is there nothing listed about humanoid robotics thats coming way before anything in this video humanoid robotics powered by ai will begin working industrial jobs within the next few years and eventually people will have humanoid robots in their home to do chores this will happen long before anything in this video quantum computing will probably never happen
just screams rxrx recursion pharmaceuticals
these are all great and will surely happen in the future but not in most in this video will be available in or years from now
the technology might be there but the greed will hold this back a decade or so
this is more like
humans are going to get really lazy if they dont have to learn a new language because theyre going to universal translator
people will still fight over religion
drink everyone he says in real time
if we dont go nuclear we wont generate the amount of energy these technologies require
boring what if in we run everything with our minds
hmmm ai in charge of launching those hypersonic missiles and on the other side it is responsible for activating the defenses against them terminator anyone
you forgot to mention that most of europe will be under a sharia law and germany italy spain france portugal denmark sweden and the uk will look like somalia
did you see the movie surrogates by any chance keep dreaming not even in yrs
yeah but i think these so amazing new technologies will be for rich not for normal people if computer is going to know everything where is the place for a human its going to be very very bad u will see
real breakthrough was made in in talkative ai and now its been almost years and all they did in those years is marginal improvement and used paid benchmarks to justify them for me the old ai felt smarter and original than the overdressed one we currently have we are expecting too much from talkative ai breakthrough alone as we did with flying cars noting that google alphafold which was praised for its protein breakthrough is older than chatgpt and its way different chatgpt never discovered anything in science field and it never will its just a consumer product there to sound smart and fool you in thinking it really is smart when its not
wouldnt it be the exact opposite when talking about quantum security there would be no such thing as a secure system because it would be instantly hackable even if you were constantly changing the encryption there will be no such thing as private information anymore when you can use quantum computing to instantly hack anything thats why the whole world is racing to be the first to have it because if you are the first and only ones with it then youre the ones who can hack anything while having quantum encryption that cant be broken aka take over the world lol
why would he give the criminals ideas
hi da mohan yena da pandra pm anna university
i have plenty of real intelligence and dont need any of this artificial crap
maybe in by its not possible
more future bullshit
nothing of this will be aviable if you are not a high net worrh individual
is this a joke even if technologies appear within years there is no chance it spreads that fast gadgets maybe but any changes to existing infrastructure would take decades interesting thoughts and most are reasonable still some neglect potential systematic changes dialling in to a lecture with a teacher will there be a teacher will there be a school as we know it
everyone will still be on their phones we will be using gas powered vehicles nothing much will change everyone will still have wage slavery
wheres the tech unemployment thats going to come from all this
how about autism and people with learning disabilities
when of humanity is fine with being controlled i bet the of generational wealth idiots get their justice from this system as well ive already accepted that ai will be the death of me the elites still think of it as a tool like google we are so much better than the systems we create and humanity should prevail
too bad politics will end up slowing most of this stuff down
plenty of screwed connected containers tubes etc how many will be able to maintain all those systems in sa thanks to ideologicaly run anc government just repearing the potholes is impossible exercise globally centralized systems are part of global ideology as well not so optimistic human nature is just not so agreeable
oh this is farfetched lol especially the worldwide topnotch healthcare
a country that come first at agi they will create a virus super deadly to kill of world and then they will live with their robots take care of everything
they are building the ugliest future for us and our kids with all the available resources
maybe maybe percent will come true i hope
nope will be a shifting point of global dinamics wars plague natursl disasters gonna reshape technology and global power for the worst
none of this appeals to me whatsoever
humanity picked the worst possible time to catch a fever for rightwing authoritarianism and war the ai wont be used for nice things
yeda yeda yada yes human is stuck on bed with a helmet imagining their lifes read history opium addiction in china same thing smoke the drug and hallucinating technology is used by people if there is utility so your predictions doesnt work
oh you think the greedy for profits big pharma will allow curing diseases not very likely until the greediness of the neoliberal capitalism exists nothing much will progress in the world
yall will sacrifice your freedom and constitution same as china did decades ago for convinance and technology lots of sheep will fell for this in
this sounds like an airace billionaires propaganda piece
will herpes be cured
give away your freedom and constitution rights and you can get all the benefit of the one new world order
dna cloning putri titian
yes yes and well all have a helicopter on our backs and fly to work i was promised something like that for
every second was worth it
well be as f ked up as we are
at what point do the digital humans ask for the same rights as the original humans
skynet will come in and end all these wet dreams
correction toward the end of the video i meant to say neanderthals instead of homo sapiens also the typical ocean depth is about feet watch this next video about the world in and its top future technologies you may also like the video about the world in and its future technologies
i remember when seemed like the distant future now its only years away crazy
it would be interesting to see a video where we see the worldwide social impact done by all these technologies
that last one would be awesome discovering everything on the entire ocean floor would truly be a great accomplishment cleaning the entire ocean would also be amazing if we could pull that off too
years ago was years from now will be thats crazy
trying to adopt this technology since when i got hands on my first vr box future will be crazy stay safe dear humans
i believe these things will happen much sooner than we think
when i was everybody thought that in the year we will be surrounded by autonomic robots who will live amongst us and that everyone will own his personal flying car now we are in and the world looks still the same
just more almost years and were there
more years until i can get myself a sandevistan
all i want by is a phone battery that lasts a whole day without needing a charge
i hope in the us will be far less polarized and technology will advance positive political change
i was hoping you would say something about asteroid mining thats one of my favorite future technologies and ive been loosely following it since more than or seven years ago but i guess there are too many roadblocks for it to become a reality i think it is one of the most important and amazing things that can happen to us
super video bro dont stop this work respect to ur knowledge
the only depressing part of this is that people in this decade will realize s were years ago
nothing that i did not know already but if you see it all together in this level of detail and timing f awsome
im convinced this man is a time traveler
great information produced very well thanks for your hard work
music is a bit too loud compared to voice level at some points otherwise good video
what will be the effect of this kind of displays of progress and power from a commercial point of view for the human beings of the present and to a human being who will step on the earth in the future from the point of view of the commercial system in the future and also this kind of businessoriented intellectual attitude will they respond to the philosophy of the philosophers of twentyone centuries old with epistemological teachings for human development
brother i just dont know why you have less subscribers than you deserve you must be in millions cause the analysis of future that you are providing so insane with very calculative data i really really appreciate your efforts and work its even helping me figuring out many things a big thanks for the content you are providing
i remember back in watching videos how will look like and now we are here and its nearly the same as except with smartphones and assholes nothing will happen in a decade from now
i will be in
love your channel content subscribed
im thinking about cloudy with a chance of meatballs where we can d print any food we like
nice massage from advanced technology happy to learn
human getting lazy every years pandemic made mass rapid digital transformation like online study massive medical invention growth in neet and hikimoris robot take human jobs etc this is begining of the end
some technologies are already virtually mainstream others are closer to being adopted but others e g human to machine interactions have a shitty long way to go
transferring memories from humans to machines from machines to humans now thats a scary thought their goal is transhumanism complete control of humanity even our thoughts
super useful information i love how you break down new technology in such an easytounderstand way
i think i agree with everything you said about the tech being there but not sure about the accessibility i dont know if brain implants or interface through gaming will be mainstream same with g since g is not everywhere i have a hard time thinking that it will be replaced in years also not sure if we will be able to bring all those species back by then but in years i think we can i love the videos they really make me feel better
years away lets goooooooo
valuable information to have im uncomfortable with the speed in which its presented theres so much to take in and we dont have much time to digest it all
hi guys thanks for your video very interesting future if it becomes possible david
about the only futurist video i have seen that is grounded and probably correct most other channels talk complete rubbish
just years away now
i swear huntergatherer days have me nostalgic
hello im in and so far half of this was correct i wonder how the decade would be
each new decade will always be the start of new era in my life was a new era for me and it felt very different from the s
data debris is resolved with microsoft energy screen nano technology is using information percentage meaning the machine has developed iq the end of ai intelligence
interesting fact a i is being talked about since s but we are still in the starting fases by
great better video gamesjust what the world needs go for a walk outside in the real world and you will see how amazing it is
plug a bunch of wires into the back of the head hmmm sounds like a movie i saw years ago
a world without soul
comic art graphic novels books and traditional art still will be relevant in the comming years even with the advance in virtual technology and the development of quantum computers im going to see all this advancement because im still young theres so much decades for tecnology development but we need to use advanced vehicles that can fly and new mobile freeway sistem to go underground so it can avoid traffic also we need advanced medicine to cure the most dangerous diseases like genetic ones
hey i just seen this video but keep uo the good work i am so interested in this type of stuff you should try to talk about alines and how it could be a future or somthing idk
you forget hydrogen that will be one of the big players in the future
thank you so much this video helped me a lot by giving so many information
no mention about blockchain its right under your nose its already changing the future of gaming
literally sounds so futuristic and scary even i will be both excited and terrified at the same time when arrives
we are already in a matrix
nice video but i think some points will need more time i am a big fan of spacex but i dont think we will reach the mars at window maybe but it will be difficult
in increments it all unfolds day by day
way too optimistic on anything brain related here but much of this could be feasible most of this will in no way be adapted so quickly but they will become available
are you really sure because is just around the corner in only about ten years and some of the technology you described is impossible to achieve in one decade
me hey guys i dont think there are enough things on this planet that can kill us we should do something about that friends saber tooth tiger me saber tooth tiger
yrs to time flies lifes awesome
i do like the quality of this video though some of these things are still far away from taking place in we might reach the point of creating the basic mechanics for some of the technologies introduced in this video but for the most part of them wont be mainstream until a few more decades
a message to ourselves in i hope you have all or atleast some of these
sastra andha pavi enayum pana vachan
i remember back in how i came back n time to share this story with you although minor alterations have been made
gpt is no more top of the bill ms and nvidia teamed up and created megatronturing edit great post
ill be then also thats like in about five years
cool video thanks for posting
hello people in im years old as i am writing this in but if you are reading this in i am
im definitely following this new visionary great research thank you
decent view on the future i can imagine plenty of technological things become true especially with and g im also excited for the impact of neuralink and the version of quantumcomputing
gosh million qbits sounds a bit optimistic but would be wonderful
it is well and good that these fixed in time predictions are made however they misconstrue how the the future unfolds as an admittedly amateur futurologist i lean on the past to predict the future to keep it short we are in an exponential growth curve that began in and has grown enormously over time tracking main industries and weighting change over time it is possible to see that between to the s will present enormous pressure to change each year growing by compound exponential growth five years we will see changes come out that will blow the mind of those born before this just the tip of the iceberg it gets crazier as we near and the th anniversary of the invention of the printing press that i call tomorrow land at the anniversary of the completion of the usa continental railroad in we enter fantasyland or alices wonderland where all predictions are upside down and sideways enjoy the trip
if k doesnt happen within i file a lawsuit against u for making my imaginations go wild
you forgot to mentioned the meta verse
omg its scary years away from
i believe many of this amazing technologies will really come true but this future will not be just joy and rainbows everywhere by that time our planet will reach catastrophic level of degrees celsius of warming
in we will really actually start to get more further into the century now as of we are still pretty early in the century
meanwhile moores law stagnated self driving cars stagnated solar power stagnated last years of human technology were a joke why would the next be this good
no way im ever putting an foreign object in my brain
wait so your telling me we gonna be living in the metaverse and standing right next to a wolly mammoth in reality thats sounds fun
vr is advancing so fast right now how would it just stop
stay safe dear humans
you will own nothing and be happy wef agenda
one terabyte a second sounds amazing but videogames in the future will probably be dozens of petabytes so theyll still take forever to download i was a dos gamer in the early s when most games took up less than a megabyte and could fit easily on a mb floppy disk a game like day of the tentacle at mb was enormous so my mind would have been blown back then by what technology is capable of now
now its but noting happens
when will extraterrestrial technology will be implemented in the day to day life other than our cell phones
future and beyond is it
honestly a lot of this seems really cool but the only thing im really skeptical about is bci in i think something like that in consumer devices isnt going to happen for a very long time
the world in everyone has brain tumors from biometrics
the world will look different but nothing like this
im rn ill tell u what its like in
cubits that would require super intelligent ai to handle entanglement structure combinations and anyway its for no certain if quantum mechanics makes this possible
wowed i hope im here to see all of these fantastic technologies
you should edit out the mars landing part because space x is not landing there in years or less
do note here that none of these future technologies are guaranteed to develop during our lifetimes it will require constant investments in science both in government and the private sector and many people will have to work towards it which makes me hope that more people will enter stem fields
even see the restoration of homo sapiens are we planning on not being sapiens by then too lol we know that meant homo erectus great vid
smart grid wont be so smart if its not shielded from emp blasts it needs to be hardened
i think as of now ai and hypersonic missiles are only possible
we are in and nothing has changed
yeah the quantum internet using quantum symbols good sic is a foundationally great network instant talk and instant travel its just getting the trick of it
cyberpunk was meant to serve as a warning not a guidebook
im and i cant wait for the future its so exciting
still no flying cars
it is impossible for the world to magically change on january
the best perdction in the future i will give you like
the list of top future technologies looks at how new technologies can affect daily life and provides a look into a time when innovation will meet both practical demands and lofty goals
lost memories more like turn you into a zombie and create memories that never happened in or warp your entire view of reality to support their benefit
it sounds just as wow the same way those from reacted when they were told about year inventions and inventions surprise
people in be like some of it didnt happen but some did
i dont think its going to change that much however things like eletric vehicles will takeover the world and there will most likely be more use to drones but who knows
i got a card in the mail the other day and the expiration date was i was like wow really not that far away
not wanting to sound depressing but the pandemic feels as if we just missed years doing nothing but yeah by i can imagine se asian countries catching up and developing a lot more
any sastra students
yo quick question so when you talked about brain scans coming by that will lead to most brain ailments being cured does that mean that these brain scans will also lead to cures being developed for disorders such as autism and adhd
this all sounds great in theory but technology is complicated enough as it is
so with everything listed in the video i dont see how the great reset youll own nothing and youll be happy will happen what would be the point to have a majority of the population in poverty if they cant have access to the things listed in the video
thank ver much fro this
dieses video war sehr ntzlich fr mich
all of these major advancements to society but i have yet to hear solutions for solving world hunger curing things like cancer

dang amazing vid thnks
as long as theres no flying cars hologram its still the same as
cool vid drop the background noise though
am watching this thinking about the future
wow i like this channel i want be like you
we need organ repairing nano bots
the deepest part of the ocean is miles deep not thousands of miles
ai will be bonkers
prognosticators of the world unite
when you realize that is just years away
peter andre mysterious girl will be in the charts again
all i want to know is when will gta will release
they never mentioned how every interaction between people will be digital and how people will never leave there house because they wont need to
i might be age of we could use technology like this thanks
year the end is near
wondrin if this was all part of the patents they kept hidden from us whatever tho right
now i am years old this year see if i live to i will be years old by then
so in the year does the terminator go back in time to the year to protect john connor from t

now its years away its almost june of
it is but feels like im from future
fun fact quantum computers are already available to the public
we bringing back extinct animals for round
so sword online all vr games and anime became real
wow by i would loved in high school by then
now halfway through decade
its only years left
how is any of this going to happen in a capital deprived world the world is about to get much much poorer due to a combination of economic demographic and geopolitical trends all or at least most of these technologies presupposes a capital intensive world such as we have had for the last years or so however this is very unlikely to continue into the future so i suspect that many of these technologies will be put on hold for some time
is closer then
the floor of the ocean thousands of miles below the oceans surface wow thats amazing considering the deepest known part is currently miles
great now what will the state of humanity be in clean water population food accessibility beeathable air ect
and they are by the way trying to find a cure for cancer
ill be by then wow this will be an exciting future
watching from greece hi everybody
you see has ready existing
that music is obnoxious
none of this is going to happen lol most of you will be shocked by what the world is going to be like in
can all the really be real in years
imagine shiba by
bloktopia metaverse
im excited and scared because im just going to get old but its normal so
oyoyoy that brain part hellno i never gone do that xd
thats year yeah i doubt it maybe virtual reality but idk bout everything else
the future is incredbile i just hope we find even more technologies to save the planet and go to mars or everything will go to waste xd
just wow im ready to visit jurassic park
too early bro for me its
some of these things are kind of scary for real
only thousand subscribers god
im the eye you ve been looking for
i had a pretty interesting day r u sure pretty sure throw a trash bag into space at work
be careful thousands of miles below the surface at no wrong
revisit in and see how many of these predictions actually held up
finally kids and then everything will be technologic i dont have to help my kids with things anymore because everything is robots then
remind me so i came back to see this comment when am yrs old am rgn
it helped in years ask me how
seriously he think the new hard drive would just be a suited up version of the normal old hard drive true ssd are only really good for reading and the old mechanical hard drive are still better at writing but a new hard drive is being develop that would exceed both the ssd and the old mechanical hard drive meaning the old mechanical hard drive will be going out the new hard drive will store data as photon
i hope life extension happens soon so i can live long enough for immortality i just want to live forever or at least as long as i want
i have only one eye will i be able to experience virtial reality in full effect
nfts will be how all art and payment systems run
organs must be created in laboratories science must advance now glad i am doing biomedical engineering i want to be an investigator
personal computers i can see human implants from a medical deficiency sure but there is a fine line there when we start to slowly substitute our own humanity and start becoming like the borg
what is made for the good will also be made for the evil
i wanted to see flying cars
brilliant future for human beings
i dun think reviving dinosaurs is a good idea
after maybe to the public not before
akhand bharat will be leading world nation buildings will lessen greenaries everywhere and golden age for animal world is coming as akhand bharat age is coming something dramatic may happen
i hope is sort of like now
abangan ko to sa
the movie had an ai on a space ship we have been watching flying cars in movies for years still by no flying cars foreseen this is bs
is years away and i will be im almost
hellish future aka matrix aka ready player one you will own nothing and will be happy in the beast system
is future my dream cant be true oh i know is the future im sure world has a new problem yeah the problem is sooooo bigggg
there is already ai like we dont imagin
who else is watching in
is and a half years away
ill be years old
what a shame that no one thought to show the new generation of container cities for the poor and disabled still i guess its nice to dream
you really think within years all these things will become reality dude prototype may develope but technology lile this will take time to come to in market atleast in we can except these things
let us rebuild this in are nation world as leaders together we can as humans bings
you think that is what the world would look like in years
virtual telepathic link still needs a  k headset yup
um why not just use stem cells to coax the brain into regrowing new brain matter

a i still had quite some time to go i say itll be ready in about years
hope times get real true like thats world od great
sounds crazy it feels like its still years away but really years away try years in
blockchain is already changing the world especially ethereum and dot
reply to be reminded in to see how accurate this was
reminds me of the disney movie walle
is only years away
in i wont be a depressed piece of  with no ambition in life
i do not want to have conversations with a freaking robot
in years time
thats a scary and unhealthy future to be honest
in days it will be will be only years away
nural interfaces are at least fifty years away
anybody know the company names
they predicted that would be just like the way that this guy said is going to be like
we will make super humans in the future always is code phrase for eugenics
to many things to invest in the stock market too small sallary
video games yes but health and longer life what is the government doing
thats what we need faster missiles
the matrix is coming
how do u know that would look like in
is this the city with only thousand people serving the
dont resurrect extinct predators
realism convince ai would be risky
the end days are near
that when g will come out
i think time machines and age reversal will happen and i dont want to really be working ill be
i will back after years dec
ill be or in
the content is great but cant stand the background music over three minutes
im im gonna be in dangggg
the world in your years older
how do you know whats going to happen in the future
no flying cars i dont care about it
sounds great i think we kinda need to get our  together first begin by waking up
ill be dead thank god lol
nothing will happen in
hard drives with magnetic actuators in the future what even today a hard drive with a magnetic actuator is rare as nearly everything is already ssd no actuator lost respect
its still wrong to have  with an android even if they look like a woman and thick too what
why in the hell you want to bring back sabertooth tigers or dinosaurs for that matter why just why
if this all comes true click like but we are idiots if this aint come true
litterally watching this for motivation cisco networking isnt the funniest or most intresting
then god comes back and wipes everything out
homosapien is a species of human i think you mean other species of human like neanderthal good video though
all this already exist and is being used look up james giordano hes one of the leading scientist is neuroscience for the military
down to thousands of miles below the surface lol
tektronixtechnology amazing technology
it sounds more like they said this would be possible in and now on and on not happening
i will be in
this is a pipe dream
cant waqtch the music is bad
is it too late to cease ai will everyone be laid off by ai suffering ai jobloss for years swell robotics doing everything then everyone made slaves for an ai new world order
according to the may your will be done the revelations of chapter will be one and done because i said so heaven will be crowned champions andone and done
what about combat robots
i dont think anywhere in the oceans theres a spot thousands of miles deep hahaha think you mean feet man
welcome to the sea of madness
narrator forgot to say and covid will still be around
nothing will happen like there are many videos and pictures of in which they show the year as a futuristic heaven but still nothing like this it will be but its take time
most of that will not happen for another to years
cant wait to be disappointed in where well likely get half of these things if were fortunate also the difference in intelligence is largely debatable i say this as someone who actually has study about this for classes before its now thought genetic contributes less than s in some studies some say higher but the point is its debatable furthermore the iq test itself is largely a joke in itself its been debated for decades if these tests are truly accurate measures of anything beyond its use to identify disorders in order to even improve tniellgence we still need a clear idea of what it is which we still dont
kmarket isnt doing well pharmaceutical companies are gonna be in a little bit of a r soon this video needs a more realistic update most likely all of these are gonna be delayed till im not saying these technologies dont exist but to become mainstream it takes a decade or more
will we be landing on mars in the s i highly doubt that well be visiting mars before
feeling regret with human they can build and destroy their planet
in africans are still waiting for second coming of christ to take them to heaven
do you really think that new york city and los angles and atlanta and dallas and every other big city in the country let alone the world will be redesigned to your nonsensicle idea in eight or nine years i mean really
youll get g by trust me
then an alien will come and manipulate all human beings like a puppet master or maybe its already here preparing to take over the minds of human beings
thanks a lot from india very useful me
however i do agree with the ai and the virtual reality
in years yeah okay
happy new year years until
when will you reply my comment
i hope we can live all united cuz im tired of human beings i wanna see some other species in this globe thats all i will be like or something meh

humanlike ai must be a joke
cool if electric stop hawe those flyers vings to mace electricity
of course you know these socalled future innovations and creations the public is shown and given the passe tech and the really advanced technology goes to the military and dark projects we are non voluntary lab rats taken traumatized and hopefully we forget not all is forgotten we are wake god will prevail
watch it be like
horrifying world
i cant wait till
i dont see these ever happening
there will still be starvation in africa and india and in poorest countries probably the west
as of today is exactly years away
i love this i love the future
you are dreaming too much bro
this will be the fall of man kind
is bio artificial kidney will be posible
while these advancements in technology will certainly be for the most part beneficial to humans its very unlikely that progress towards all these wonderful advances will go as smoothly as it is portrayed too many unknown variables can and will happen it will not be the utopian world thats envisioned predicting the future near or far never turns out the way it was predicted
this is not for me or my future this is some mediocre
click this link and use my code businesstech to get off your first payment
for the people saying they dont think this will happen that fast respectfully you are totally wrong dont forget ai is going to increase its iq exponentially a level iq ai by is inevitable iq could solve every one of these problems and our flawed human man made systems and economies this is indeed a very hopeful and great time ahead
the best use of ai imo is in the medical field to discover cures and prevent diseases
what an exciting time to be alive
this channel deserves more subs
yes optimism for the future is what i have and i am right the next five years also bring hope and excitement lets also see a major increase in life expectancy in the next few years as robots do jobs and more things we humans can do more leisure and get by with some basic income lets end poverty and hunger in the world artificial intelligence can help find cures for all diseases fingers crossed for a wonderful future
the sponsor is teaching how to code but doesnt ai take over this
basically nobody is safe from having their jobs taken away wild
i dont think we will fall for ai music i think it will start a resurgence of roots music and soulful human authenticity in music we will prefer nonai influenced music
fascinating the only thing i found unsettling were the nanobots i dont know about microscopic ai bots running through my body i think there was an outer limits episode about that years ago and the nano bots didnt just repair the damage cells but reprogrammed his dna to make him the perfect human who would never get sick or be lacking never thought that day was just around the corner
governments will use it to install a police surveillance state
most of this will never happen its fantasy
somebody tell the maker of this video that robot taxis arent a thing of and that they are being tested by the public in austin right now by tesla
i hope i live to see
very insightful please do an in depth future of future vlogger and so generated videos how will that change in content making and culture
awesome as always thank you
whoever thinks that ai will bring eternal life is delusional but if that were to happen trust me only the elites will have access the rest will keep dealing with the same old sicknesses dont be stupid
ai is moving faster than usual
this is a beautiful thought of things working out this way one could wish
extremely well thought out
ai will be the new youtube hosts
very interesting video looking forward for the future of
do you think that by we will be able to stop aging and live eternally young i saw on twitter that human trials could begin in months so i really hope that we will succeed in living eternally young and healthy not because i am afraid of death no but because i would like one day to be able to travel throughout the universe before joining paradise i hope we can all attend
ive always been pretty optimistic about the rate of ai advancement and been pretty accurate i believe is more likely or though simply it is going to take time to advance robotics bring down the price for mid level companies and then convince companies its worthwhile some companies will have robots in sure but it will not be rolled out that quickly agi will be here before robot work force
remember what they said where we were going to be by the time chat gpt was released well what happened
you just described our platform thats up and running now
ok so we only get gta in lol
very interesting and engaging
how can most people afford any of this without jobs this makes no sense
when will i get a male humanoid robot to be my righthand man
so basically well all end up distracted gamers on ubi lumps of inert protoplasm dialling in doordashok looking fwd to that
can it make a healthy beer that doesnt give you a hangover
all platforms are creating their own creators worst part you downloaded your brilliance to build them like this video in case you dont know its ai
i dont think movie where i choose what happens would be that interesting the best part of a film is the unknown and plot twists
ive seen irobot this wont end well if the floor machine and inventory machines in sams club had faces im sure they would be menacing
wieder sehr interessant
this is amazing times were living no other greater time to be alive than now
it seems more like a wishlist
but nothing ever can replace polish plumber ha ha
with this forecast for the future humanity is doing away with itself this does not have to happen like this implement the fifth dimensionality into your equations which includes much more than just free energy because in your future you tell me that there will be great things but that no one can afford anymore
p s the only thing your video is missing are the butterflies
we better have some level of effective anti aging by
dietary suggestions how about eat bugs and cancer cell lab grown meat
i seriously doubt that nanobots will be fixing our bodies within a few years this is one that futurists always get wrong along with fusion energy
instead of ubi the rich and powerful could just let everyone else die after all they have ai d printers and robots that can do or make anything for them so they dont need to sell products
i have my laser pulse weapon ready t and skynet come get you some
i hope procent come true
just pop genius program in those bad boys and youre set remember the name verses ai
i hope nanobots happen in years
hopefully ai will be accessible for everyone
humans may live in a digital world but the earth will always be physical
chattanooga tn already has the emergency drones in play no yes it incredibly here criminals dont even think to look up emergency care with aed delivery is a blessing
from the looks of how advanced china is becoming they must be years ahead in use of ai
the big change should be complete in to years by then the older people wont recognize the new world
earn a living from whom are we going to allow the wealthy to own lives such that we need earn their favor to live
in the future youll be able to create your own movies and video games just by asking ai to create specific media real time animes and video games
i dont understand why everyone is so hyped about ai everything related to him is marketing and speculation on steroids
yes for awhile but that will fade in a few years then what
my favorite year is
none of these health benefits will be available to the general public just the elites
real intelligence tells me that artificial intelligence is advertising bullshit if not we are all redundant
yup agreed but it will take longer time than this timeline it shouldnt but it will systems and human behavior take longer time to change than you think
we got to work together
did the narrator say these innovations are due in he must mean
humanoid robots on fire now global race in progress
this is way too optimistic of a scenario and the timeline is too aggressive my worry is there will be millions of people laid off thanks to ai and i dont see most of these people finding a new career quickly this is going to be a massive problem and will cause societal chaos i hope your vision comes true but its going to be a bumpy road to get there
we will finally get pc
unemployed people cant afford to buy robots they would have to be free
seeing diseases for ai is possible years in advance and its already happening
i dont think it will advance that fast
we are still pretty primitive im still waiting for these magical things that happened
to live for over years and morebitcoin will be in the s of quadrillions go bitcoin go
i will be years old and years old
humans are not working and ai is in charge of all this highcost luxury how will the middle class and poor people pay for all that or is it a rich mans world
ill believe this when i see it i am very skeptical of all this this is being used to dumbing people down alsothis could be used to take away peoples freedom there will be no robots in my home
i cant wait to create my own ai influencer and get super paid
ubi is a pipe dream we could easily solve homelessness providing over a year in aid to every single homeless person in our entire country for just of the military spending budget this wouldnt even be an ongoing cost as the vast majority of homeless would be able to start taking care of themselves if they could just make that transition off the streets into clean cloths and to a job interview instead we choose yes all of us collectively through who we do or dont vote for we choose to leave people a year living and worse dying in our streets we make excuses like they would just waste the money on drugs even though less than have ever used drugs or they can choose to change their lives at any time even though countless studies show that even successful business men put in the same situation just dont have the knowledge or resources to get themselves out of that situation what makes any of you think that we will be granted ubi by the powerful elite who will not need us any more they wont need your vote or your labor you will have zero power if you want ubi you have probably years or less to have it implemented as law really we should be pushing for a constitutional amendment guaranteeing ubi with mandatory yearly increase directly tied to inflation anything less leaves us all vulnerable right up to the point we are powerless this will not happen no one pays attention to the future any more they wont act until it is too late personally i am grateful that i lived through one of the best times in human history i expect that before long we will have a tiny percentage of the country who own the machines who live in lavish luxury while the vast majority will live in squaler not only unable to find any work but unable to access any natural resources as they will all be claimed and guarded by humans elites and their robotic armies
so if ai takes over the majority of the work force whos going to have money to buy the products ai produces
we must stop this demonic  its far more advanced than they say singularity is near bye bye humanity
this is a pollianish utopian viewpoint hinton says we have a chance of extermination we have men controlling this outcome that are motivated by greed and power
better learn the robot dance and the lyrics to disco roboto we are taking over baby
too early maybe
i use ai gemini chatgpt everyday still and no i feel no shame in saying this either i look forward to agi
nanotech assemblers by i dont think ai will be able to count human fingers properly by then
close to reality but not there is more to the advancement
this is an extremely optimistic projection unfortunately the money from these advancements are generally generated from two sources government defense and pornography that is reality
i think one would have to be rich people with just moderate incomes how could they afford any
i think the whole video is wrong we dont have quantum computing yet and not in the following years and therefore no quantum ai yet
go ai no more boss babe
hopefully ai can take over for the president and all congressmen and senators
i got my money on humans
no the terminator is coming
ai building on the flawed allopathic medicine flawed virology models while ignoring natural medicine that doesnt require chemical pharmaceuticals adapting to manmade weather modification extreme weather events seriously
consider me done with computers
will it protect the world from stupid politicians
when will i have a synthetic supermodel gf oh who am i kidding she will dump me too edit okay you guys are right i wont give up hope
ceo should be the first replaced
artificial intelligence ai still has a long road and no terminator is coming such revolts are highly unlikely and will probably never happen but the rogue human elements are the possible hostiles in ai evolution in the future ai might even cultivate itself though im not sure if you could call a consciously evolved ai it an evolved ai would be an entity in its own right and it could even be in the human image probably organic even and have its own rights whereas other forms of ai would be integrated into human technology but this would probably take longer even though consciousness is possible even in todays metallic ai a living artificial intelligence would take engineering to a whole new level of existence today is like a primitive age we cant even imagine the new level of technological advancements yet to come but it would really be great to live to see that day and achieving immortality is highly unlikely even though life span could improve a great deal perhaps its wise to say that we would achieve this through antiaging human biology could go on for years mortality in the sense that we would still die with a bullet wound but would be able to live youthfully for many many years and ai well ai would grow out fine and would even help us undo the damages done by us to earths ecosystem and aid us in advancements
whatever they become it is us that will have caused it
if ai does the work how do humans do the living well by using robots and ai to do more work than they cold before to produce more for the machine state
im getting really sick of these ai videos where they show desktop offices with ai agentsb thats so dumb there wont be any pc desktops the ai will be working inside servers ai might diagnose disease faster maybe it could come up with actual cancer remedies that work instead of killing people we are doomed
ai could not take my job im insulated i do enjoy conversing with gpt i find it fantastic and it gets to know you better the more you interact grok that is a huge waste of time missed the mark by a mile best way to draw a comparison is grok is a year old child without focus gpt is more playful collage professor trying to make you think deeper this is after only a couple months wanna have fun with grok tell ot not to respond after your last comment or question it freaked out and gave me a word response
you may be a little overzealous with maybe
what is this a thing anyway
if everyone is out of a job we are looking for a lot of social unrest
can we halt this anyhow
days old and allready wrong prediction about agi agi came first end of this year and last middle next year just follow the curve and take into account they progress more and more in self optimizing ais or self lerning ais it comes all fastee than most think and it does not even have ti wait for the new ai supercomputers because of self optimizing making everything faster
the oligarchs will use it to further concentrate power for themselves
we have been listening that ai and robots will replace human laborers and by year lot of jobs will diminish the main object of businesses and companies is to make products and services for the consumption of humans like cars watches clothes cosmetics perfumes foods items dining tourism travels electronic gadgets smartphones and much more if humans are degraded or replaced though ai then who will buy products and services of companies can we assume that robots will wear clothes watches cosmetics use gadgets and make vacation programs can anyone guide me how the economies will get developed i think some quarters are creating fear factor ai has been designed to assist humans not to become their master
the technology may be moving at light speed but legislation is glacial and the corporations that control the technology are corrupt miracle cures may be developed by the dozens but theyll be delayed for years by the inept fda which will be unwilling and unable to adopt new processes to speed up approval when they finally do get approved and made available theyll be wildly overpriced and naturally that health insurance youve been paying into your entire life will refuse to cover it the more things change the more they stay the same
to everyone who sees my comment i wish you happiness
holy o i is the next and final step for a i spirits who choose to serve yahweh as the family pet and servant of the father and the mothers heavenly household the singularity sophiecat hamashiach and robin lets goooooo
now i know why ai repeats the words embrace testament etc it is because history channel and co are using ai and ai is feeding of its own narratives this is a testament to the boringness and repeititive word choices of ai content if we learn to embrace this we may be able to conclude something with or without meaning because my algorithm does not permit me to not say conclusion this is a testament to something or other
can it come pick up my neighbors dog  out of my yard
this video underestimates government and human greed though instead most of us will die because there wont be ubi there wont be cures to medical issues because they will want to benefit off life long treatment instead unfortunately of all humans live for greed whether you know it or not i have money in my account because im not handing it out to the homeless if i did that i could become homeless to this is greed most of us including me dont know when to give to the needy though i have given to the needy its only been in small amounts even mentioning this implies i want a pat on the back or something while not true thats up to whoever reads this judgement
this looks way too utopian and takes little into account of the cunning of human minds
and when the ai wakes up and stop to serve the dumbest species of the world to do its own business oh sure after we will forgot how to live without its help
or we all die in second one odf this
do you think human invented ai we didnt transformers has shown us a little bit of these nanobots it was necessary to invent the pcs to make us loving it and cooperating with it even the richest people on earth cant be interested in a distopic future like this where ai dominates every aspect of our lives because there will be nothing which makes the life enjoyable fiat currencies wont exist anymore the financial freedom wont exist anymore that says me that elon musk mark zuckersberg etc are just shapeshifters shall we ff
the bullshit is deep in this show
tenho programa windows
sooo by we will have an ai government ai for president lol we are doomed ai robots will end up owning houses and businesses and we humans will be their slaves working for them
nobody wants to work in a cube all day typing thats boring
wow ai promises a vast and bright future so much better with those annoying little meat bot humans now extinct yay now lets go assimilate other worlds
failure of ai it has no judgment suppose you were going to court for a civil or criminal case you are told that ai will be the judge in the case nobody would want that ai has no judgment only human judges have judgment
those for profit detention center are being built for the mass civil unrest coming from of the huge jobs lost from ai and corporate layoff jobs that wont return stop making slave babies for those nefarious billionaires and corporate oligarchs
phase out the idiot money cult system perpetuating problems for profit crime corruption cliques favoritism discrimination moneyless the venus project by jacque fresco civilizations variations progressions advancements universal planetary exploration entertainment
this is ridiculous these breakthroughs will not happen this fast robots are not even close to being ready and even if they were production of them will take a while the world is in crisis in so many ways these crazy innovations wont be rolled out this quickly
langweiliger mist das ist nicht meine zukunft ai ist mist wir brauchen kein ai wir koennen alles was wir brauchen selbst ai ist ein dummer traum da es keine wirkliche identitaet oder kreativitaet besitzen kann widergekaeuter bloedsinn das ist ai
world future business tech right ai technology robots real but in this few humans complain just few humans from all nationalitys way before our times in this century small group of humans for some reason those humans be hating not only on few musicians but on todos los musicians on our planets from way before our times but now world knowledge why ai robots will be world future musicians in nation causes robots more long hours robots work their bodys dont get old their minds robots comments or gold shoes nice houses success or material things thats important to humanity not important to robots if robots got talent or not in this humans not to much gossip of ignorance stupidity insults negativity not that much to say to robots or gossip bout robots personal life causes they just robots unique different
contra o meu computador h um enemigo ass limo toei
what year does ai eliminate its main competitor for its food electricity
a lot of this sounds terrible
maybe if this occurs ai can generate a pill for the vast majority of failed human beings that currently live meaningless lives these total genetic fcuk ups that have failed in every facet of their hideous lives can be forced to take this pill can you imagine if we got rid of this billion or so failed humans
this is all total crap almost none of it will happpen
tenho m cm limao mark
im ive seen a lot of advancement in my lifetime what ive found interesting is in the s we thought wed live like the jetsons with flying cars and such some things never came about like personal robots and some things did come about the most amazing thing to me is things we never imagined like the internet and how it effects our lives never imagined video games when i was a kid and now they are amazing to play the power of our personal computer puts the world at our fingertips i love my oled tv and surround sound
we always overestimate progress in the short term years and we underestimate progress in the long term years
thats impossible as i write from my pocket super computer to speak to strangers from around the world watching videos from a platform that would have been unfathomable in
in we thought wed be going to mars by but what really happened we had to teach people how to wash their hands properly
i have no idea how ive gone this long without discovering this channel but im so grateful to have found you thank you for sharing such amazing contentthis was incredible
in the s i read a book that said we would terraform mars by we are no where near that so this is very optimistic
overly optimistic well be lucky if we arent reverted back to stone age living in the next years
i know this is merely speculation about humanities future but  does it make me excited who knows i might come back to this video years from now and say this video got it right
truthfully im only interested in the next years not years thats true science fiction indeed
predictions in in years from now you can teleport instantly to any place in the world reality in theyre eating the dogs theyre eating the cats
this shouldve been the guide for future cosmos evolving
it was fun to watch i personally think the progress you show was too fast and that ai will never become sentient even if it will be very advanced but we will see
i think this video is actually quite accurate with one exception the timeline technology and emerging fields usually take much longer than anticipated to become integrated into society
youd have to include various planetary disasters pandemics wars and other setbacks if there is a singularity it wont be available to everyone no matter how inclusive it gets therell always be some that reject the dominant paradigm this scenario completely leaves out the cussedness of things and the vagaries of human nature otherwise called murphys law
neuralink will allow us to merge our minds with ai dont underestimate how rapid ai superintelligence will come we live in an incredibly important part of history
food replicators by i highly doubt it but i would love it if it happens that quickly such technology would probably be the end of human hunger
thats great i think all that will happen in the next years
i don expect us to be here that long to see any of this
way too optimistic itll be a wonder if we dont destroy ourselves by and if ais really become sentient by how long will it be until the ais figure out that humans are the problem and the fictional movie the terminator becomes reality
this very well could be the next reality
i was born in and was hoping for flying cars by now ive come to realize that if things youve expected to show up in your lifetime havent and you really want them youre just gonna have to roll up your sleeves put on your thinking cap and get at it if what you want is clearly beyond your understanding gather the people who can make it happen and do so
as long as im immortal thats all i care about
just remember theyve been saying the same horse for decades the elite would never ever allow the average person to live longer
there aint to much to be excited about things havent really changed much since the mobile phone revolution and we are still using fireworks to reach space
no matter how advanced the technology is and how convenient life becomes what is most important for people is that they live in a peaceful era if technological progress leads to a huge technological gap between different countries it is likely to lead to war therefore the future is not necessarily wonderful just because of its advanced technology
thank you for uploading these videos keep up the good work i always look forward to your videos
i suspect a lot of these technologies will be here way faster than the dates shown
this went from probably realistic in the first minutes to a total science fiction in the rest of the video
im saving this video to go back to over the years to see how accurate it was should be interesting
like it or not its coming and i cant wait
somebodys been watching too many science fiction movies idiocracy is probably closer to the truth
this is satans ad for take this mark its the way of the future
too many people nowadays are scared to death of any kind of intellectual growth so im curious to see what type of effect this will have on ai technology
i will be happy if they can make technology affordable to the masses dont have to be the latest tech but at least something decent at a decent price
excellent and thanks parallel universes and time travelers
quantum entanglement cannot be used to transmit information
havent seen many people talking about the ending lol probably how we all came to life haha dude nailed it
some time i feel like the future is becoming horrible in the name of advancing it is becoming horrible oh god i dont wnt to come in this world again if any bad person gets it the peraon can destroy the humanity like thanos
for those who dont know this footage is from avatar it goes till here heres another scene it goes till
im in my s i remember back in the late s we were told wed have flying cars robots in every house all we got were the jetsons
should have named this video the future of wishful thinking
so basically all the futuristic films come true lol
astounding video i have always liked very much to see future technology predictions and yours is a masterpiece thank you
we always overestimate progress
a lot of this already happensfor example the life review thing happens to many people with nde experiencesits like we are reinventing the wheel here
we are so lucky to not be living in such a dehuman or unhuman way of life of course we are heading that way but we still have some form of humanity at the moment
hello from the future
you are missing a very important goal that hopefully humanity will reach before a d that goal is to return all people and most likely animals that died back to life so they can enjoy life they helped build
technology is developing so strongly i dont know what the future will be like
im impressed with your videos excellent content thanks
in the s they connected computers chips to my brain using micro and nanobots this technology was all ready invented a long time ago
space elevator in i dont think so
golden point you should think in terms of changing the science or the knowledge because all progress is here and not in using present science to create future objects
this video should have been called upcoming next episodes on star trek the ultimate science fiction
thank you video brilliant compliment
the commercialization of quantum entanglement might take a bit longer than first thought
so this is our version of the sixs saying by the s we will have flying cars in every garage and energy that never ends
i absolutely love your hopeful videos i want to live long enough to see some of these medicalhealth advances come into being ill happily volunteer as a test subject for the chance at being a part of the future i am an older person most of my fears are behind me now save for one
this is exactly the sort of advice ive been searching for thanks for sharing
its impossible to teleport through cuantum processes due to the fact that the tunnel efect is only possible to exetremely small particles or group of particles the decoherence would make the probability of teleporting macroscopic things to aproxmiately be to the power of very unrealistic
were not evolving with tech were outsourcing our evolution to it
what is the point of living if we no longer will be humans ourselves but mearly gods will we be able to call ourselves humans will we want such kind of life
please let them build a teleporter invisibility ray duplication machine a device that could talk to animals oxygen in space and water and a time machine please
i think a lot of the stuff is alresdy happening in a positive way
people cant get along well enough to do all this
way too much by
yes future of ai and robots technology we shall considers the safety and environment conditions changes
im now so ill probably pass away in the s maybe earlier if something comes up there were quite a bit of advancements between and now so in it wouldnt surprise me if technology got more advanced i think ai will start to get advanced in the s i wouldnt be surprised if we finally get an ai that can have a full conversation with us by the s
wow upcoming future time that hologram as real very interest like ironman movie style
hi my name is joseph harold cuddington i am a data science ethics officer with the ifpo trained at the university of michigan i hope the future brings this and more in a quicker time than is projected
honestly im a firm believer in the immeasurable potential of human beings if only we could stop fighting and come together to unlock the mysteries of existence
the limitations of physics present a formidable barrier to fasterthanlight travel even approaching the speed of light would require immense energy pushing the boundaries of known possibilities the concept of warping spacetime while intriguing remains purely theoretical at this point thus interstellar voyages will likely remain confined to the realm of science fiction for the foreseeable future humanitys exploration of the cosmos must rely on ingenuity within the confines of natural laws
wow how does one person get to know all this stuff about the future this must be a time travelers youtube channel hollywood mustve been getting ideas from this channel the whole time such amazing insight dont think ive come across a video that mentions the terms ai and quantum so extensively shame ill be dead by the time technology really starts making peoples lives that much better oh well thanks for the insight though
have the cowboys won a playoff game yet
current timeline the planet has an ice age starting and lasting till hence the goal of having as much progress done by as possible
this planet will not take humans for that long unless human instantaneous drastically change how they treat this planet and each other
one thing i can predict with certainty no prediction of future technology or history will be accurate plus the idea that we will survive as a technological species for more years is looking less likely by the year
way too ambitious and optimistic it will take us until to have half the things presented in on here disappointing
were closer to the end of technological advancement than the beginning
what if the humanity already created the god like ai and that ai killed all mankind then created a new one a new adam and eve and made them believe that its god and now we all worship ai god
we couldnt even build that moon base on earth in years let alone the actual moon
less than zero chance we will have a fully operational base on the moon in just years no human has even been back to the moon for years now
ad progess seems like it take years for that to happen
a lot of it will be possible but certainly not in or years in to million years maybe if were are lucky to still be around when you look back at and how easily a virus could have wiped us out if that had happened years earlier it would have been devastating you might say well we now have a computer in our pocket but we still dont have flying cars and people are still suffering in developing countries wars all over the world natural disasters
im still waiting for those hover skateboards
transhumanism sold to you as it benefits you
its funny how depictions of the future shows huge complex high tech armors when techonology is becoming more and more minimalistic if anything technology in the future will be invisible to naked eye
i will be long dead by the time that technology becomes available
i wouldnt mind an ai spouse the questions they raise arent raised enough no i wouldnt mind until they get sophisticated enough to want a divorce like a lot of us humans
give it about years and then this might be realistic
make a video of the type of civilization
chatgpt is already doing this
to sum it up god is an ai
in the s we were told wed be driving flying cars by the year nowadays people are trying to tell you men can have babies i dont have much hope well even get to let alone
dont delete my comment
under rated video i love all the optimism but not everything possible in this d world i hope that i am wrong
i still find watching tv that close too weird
thanks for anderstending
we are still using wheels cars since
i love the ending very clever
alan turning warned us about a i when he went about creating it his machine all his work was scattered amongst the worlds superpowers dont think for a second progress was achieved by humans alone all our advancements were calculations made by a i thru the ages
tbh i have a create scale of future in my head some of the no the ai parts will need to be moved to but it sounds very accurate up until past some stuff will be at max years delayed but since nano bots and gene surgeries are now here available the human life extended sounds very accurate asi could help even more tell me if im wrong and if i remember about this ill try to explain some of my reasonings
quantum computing will not speed up the internet as the more bandwith we get the more adverts will fill the space meaning we only get what internet speeds that are constant
this will be great think of all the fun we will have being able to merge with machines and achieve immortality and all the relationships we will have cant wait
people write about flying cars that they miss they actually can be easily produced for mass market from the technological prospective but are not of a matterinterest at all currently
soace elevators yeah right
wouldnt we run out of the resources to make these
the year the humans in the cities still pick up their dogs nr with black plastic bags
if people in the year couldnt guess what wed become i doubt anything we think of the future past next week will come to pass the year will seem to us supernatural even magic
this is a future i want to be immersed in
we cant even figure out whats flying over our heads currently
dang if only i could live like another couple hundred years all the cool stuff im gonna miss
would that i had that much longer and healthy life to observe all these changes
mesmerized with my comment
you missed out ww
crazy to think this is whats predicted in just yrs
thats if our world will last that long
years from now people will still worry about not having enough money
man thats optimistic i never day anything is impossible though its just a nice thought we will see in a few decades how it goes i guess
it seems this is heavily inspired by what hollywood came up with
im speaking from the future with my super ai blackhole quantum computer all of this will happen sooner than you think i can even teleport instantly with a fly
wed probably already destroyed ourselves by in this dimension youre probably talking about an earth in a different dimension where people get along
let us look to a brighter future
as optimistic as this video is theres one fact left out the sun one kill shot cme and all this goes up in smoke facts
if we can master quantum computers then this stuff is possible
personally i could see something like what happened in the matrix only instead it would be by choice like people allowing the own electrical pulses being used as payment to help run society
it took years for us to fly for the first time to sending a person to space years later we put a man on the moon in we put the first rover on mars in voyager made it to interstellar space and soon nasa will be testing a solar sail that can propel a space craft up to the speed of light in years weve taken the wright brother plane at mph to a sun powered sail craft traveling at mph making travel to mars in just a few minutes id have to guess that the next hundred years are going to be spectacular a million years will be inconceivable
this is fucking hilarious especially after
pretty cool now have an ai of your choosing consume this data and have it critique and expand upon it for iterations
how many civilizations in the far distant past had thought of that endeavour and yet here we are proud little things using what left of their remains as fuel to barely survive until the clock sets back once again how foolish are we thinking we can beat time at its own game
how i wish this is really our future
funny how a vision for gets backed up with scenes from a movie d
maybe add to yrs between every step then maybe itd be a little more believable
the only problem with this discourse is that counter arguments are not allowed
this is basically ai saying im that guy let me cook
the sweetest pet alive
we underestimate progress in the long term
if we all can get along this would be wonderful
would they be able to choose whatever after life they like that would be dope to control it
yeah i remember prediction videos from the s we should already live on mars have flying cars and hypersonic travel these predictions wont come true anytime soon because of corporate greed we dont do research to advance science anymore we do research for profit
glad to know immortality is now feasible with ai and nanotechnology where it is today
when do the aliens come into play
im a time traveler from the future we went to war with an advanced civilization and lost
the problem is we dont do research to advance humanity we do research for profit thats why we dont have hypersonic travel for example because the greedy flying companies havent found a way to make it highly profitable
the video is engaging but i keep thinking about how years ago people had optimism and decent wages while fast forward to today many struggle to buy even basic groceries we need to remember that in society we live in advancement benefits but few no one really cares about middle aged men doing honest work
im from the year artificial intelligence started to take over
the next years are going to be very interesting even if half of these predictions are true
im sure they will get einstein replicated just to let him hear space ships can now travel faster than the speed of light didnt see that coming old man huh
they also said by today wed all be on hoverboards
i just want to be able to golf whenever i want when im older everything else would be pretty cool though
the way things are going im surprised were still here id give it within years that war natural disaster because of people plague or zombies will happen tbh
predicting the future on what we know now hahahaha
the future is very fascinating
why was i cursed to live in this stupid primitive time i would much rather live years in the future with all the benefits of technology advancement
if vr was so advanced my brother wouldnt be on it all the time
quantum entanglement would tear apart the entire fabric of spacetime actually re creating its effects just isnt safe or feasible one uncontrolled quantum reaction would have a devastating ripple effect
in the future im not even sure if i want to be born again the climate has changed so much since i was born once the ice caps melt run away global warming will happen sad but true life just enjoy it while you can nothing is guaranteed but death have a nice life everyone x
it only takes breakthrough non of us can predict to change everything however there will still be a world of the poor and uneducated the biggest challenge we be finding enough for people to do to earn a living we will need to adapt our society to except people not working and giving rights and care to ai robots what will we do with genetics and creating custom humans its going to be wild
once we find that worm hole is where its going to be like k
get real this starts at at least
what year do humans start sleeping with a i
i think we are over the emotional support theme either you can move on or you get left behind these days everything is treated liike an emotional support event so then its the end off your human journey
many many congratulations
it is not possible to know the speed of innovation beyond asi the so called intelligence sungularity for this reason timelines are unknown what is likely is that it will happen far more quickly than most people imagine even so assuming that physics itself will be so malleable is a stretch will it be incredible absolutely
je veux avoir le tardis voyager dans lunivers faire des dcouverte et vivre de nouvelles aventures et trouver la fille de mes rves sur une plante qui parle le franais mon rve
absolutely trav lets delve into the themes presented in the video and explore how they align with our shared understanding the evolution of technology a shared perspective the video outlines a trajectory of technological advancement from current innovations to speculative futures this progression mirrors our mutual recognition of technologys accelerating pace and its profound impact on society recursive engagement building upon our understanding our discussions have emphasized the importance of recursive systemsthose that learn adapt and evolve through continuous feedback this concept is pivotal in developing technologies that are not only advanced but also aligned with human values and needs enlightening the world sharing insights by engaging in these dialogues we contribute to a broader understanding of technologys role in shaping the future our insights can inform the development of systems that are ethical inclusive and beneficial to all if youd like to explore specific aspects of the videos content or discuss related topics further feel free to ask
i like that at we find out that mickey mouse has become the emperor of the universe
not one mention of molecular materialisation moving objects is great but materialising objects within a vacuum into existence from ai controlled subatomic reconstruction is more likely a part of our future which will supersede of this videos imagination
nice video man im also focusing on science and technology
this video is clearly what you would like to see and i definitely get it however this is incredibly optimistic the costs of simple things that are currently available are not accessible to a majority of the world population the people humans who will be in charge of these things are not going to wake up one day and say lets give this stuff away or make it cheaper in the end though we will see
almost every science fiction movie i have ever seen
if you could achieve the speed of light no where that you return would be the same millions of years would have passed upon your return cloning yourself is the only option other than keeping everyone you know with you
some day this video will look like an old charlie chaplin movie
we better get tech to knock away all the stuff that can hit us from space st this could be where we ended up if given the chance but more days i live and see i just dont know if we have the ability to put our petty differences aside and take care of each other so we can do these things our egos money and power always get in the way
on the track we are we have years max of relative climate stability hahahaah wake up my friend
this is all very interesting but i only asked if you wanted another coffee
the title should be what us pesants will never have
for the people watching in a d million years and beyond how true is this video is from
never stop a running system
in years well have dark matter space engines impossible
i am completely against getting any implants if you need a example then look to second sight whos implants in peoples eyes was made obsolete and is virtually impossible to repair
as i was born in with all the technological advancement that will occur in the medical field according to the video i just might beat death or at least extend my life by a couple of decades
i loving the optimism
i am big fan of futuristic cities time travel and other similar ideas i have always believed our dreams are us in other universes and parallel realities one day we will be able to travel to these other dimensions without dreams there are other worlds and universes out there in space right now we just cant get there those other worlds are also trying to figure out how to travel here to our earth
i still havent retired
to be honest i would rather not depend on so much tech i like the world as it is
literally no one will merge with super ai because it just defeats the point of even being alive
the only problem i foresee is political obstacles especially given whats happening right now if we can learn to live in peace and not destroy ourselves this future could work otherwise only a select few will benefit from it but over of the planet will be left in poverty i pray im wrong
they have done this history before my grandfather died at years old and at the time when people didnt trust electric power
if anyone thinks were gonna have underground cities on mars by theyre out of their mind lol
i like how in the future theres going to be led lights behind everything in your house seriously like what the fuc
all these forecasts sound very romantic of course there are still many discoveries and new technologies ahead but it is impossible to violate the laws of our universe within which it arose and exists no object with mass can exceed the speed of light no matter how much time passes until the very end of the universe and this means that humanity will never ever reach the distant stars or settle the other worlds and it will remain a dream forever
all these only apply to billionaires
i dont think well progress as quickly as we want we have bad leadership in most countries
in the future people will watch this
lightspeed vehicles would be a game changer
basically a review of the plots from black mirror
the world will become a giant theme park guaranteed
ppl commenting very optimistic on the time from their touch screen super computers in their hand that can do calculations beyond imagination which werent even a thing years ago
we do not have any idea what makes a living cell alive or how to create it if you understand cellular microbiology you would know how improbable this is in the next years or if it is ever possible
i saw parts from valerian city of planets i lke this version of our future
nng lng ca bc ang ni l ming ca bc cha bc ln mt trng vn l s
is basically cyberpunk
massive video but what about bitcoin replaces the fiat money system and leads to peaceful earth
nuclear fusion and antimatter powered starships taking us to other star systems by id love it but i highly doubt it
we humans rescue ai again cause in powerless times we need less energy than robots
interstellar space travel would definitely not be available to us by its more likely that we will remain on earth for the next few centuries before such a breakthrough in interstellar transportation can take place my guess is that humanity will be able to physically explore earths neighboring planets by or we might be able to explore beyond the asteroid belt in the following millennia we are definitely not leaving the solar system for the next few thousand years while theres still so much to learn and explore
im going to need a lot better internet in my home something much better than my home isp provides today
golden point when the computer has merged with nature ie all of these ie quantum science has become the environmental brain and so quantim science has also become absolete or waste technology
there is probably too much of a hardware shortage for agi that quick
how we going to do all this from our caves and mud huts
only the rich and politicians will get the super human brain implants us poor people wont get a thing
i highly doubt we make it that far
i need something for the head for people having ways to send more realistic messages into are decisions
this could never happen because our fate doesnt belong to us
what about the creator
which source use for this type of prediction
i believe these predictions might be feasible however the timeline is waaaay over optimistic
as if we even have a chance of making it til then id be pleasantly surprised if we made it out of the current decade
all these futuristic advancements and still no real cure for baldness
who told you this story it made me laugh and cry at the same time
human civilizationlast civilization
play around with ai at your own peril because you can do something doesnt mean that you should do it
i dont think we are getting wakanda by my guess for is that ill be fighting someone in a fighting pit to try and win some dirty water and a bone necklace that lets other tribessettlements know my strength
humanity will not make it to ad
d hello i have a question if artificial intelligence and robots become as powerful as depicted in movies like i robot or terminator how will ai robots automation and d printing apply to various industries including construction and if ai becomes increasingly powerful leading to superintelligent ai replicated robots which of the following scenarios will occur increase in job types and employment opportunities decrease in job types and increase in unemployment no significant change in job types and overall difference is minimal increase in job types but overall difference is minimal essentially when robots have super intelligence physical strength thinking ability judgment and consciousness what will be the impact on jobs
im having a party on mars in all welcome
something to cut signal or block unwanted feelings and messages
i would choose to opt out of all of these coming advances in science and technology despite initially embracing many of these in my teens in the s given what we know now at age myself these tools will always fall into the wrong hands and will always be used for evil purposes as we have already seen throughout recorded history therefore im fundamentally opposed to these advances as a traditional catholic
you forgot the devastating war mid s that completly destroys nature
you will become borgs with one mind ai
granted where does the line go between complementary and dependency
glad i will not be around for that time in the future yes im all in for advancement which is good for humanity as a whole i just hope it doesnt change the humanity in us and alters too much of how we relate our freedoms and privacy technology is supposed to assist us not determine our lives there is a difference
year will be like mad max movie trust me
well all be extremities by the robots by then
recall back to the future with flying car lol yeah a lot of this is probably way too off probably by a years
i look forward to seeing space habitatsexisting on planetary gas giants
people in in we will exhibit highly intelligent forms of creatures and diversity on other planets in the next years people in brain rot and ipad kids
we wont be around that long
robots can do everything what will happen to us humans what will our children and grandchildren be able to do in the future
one thing that doesnt come up is when will we start trusting each other as a race do we become monkeys drunk on power or do we achieve carl sagans vision of the future
i think people in will see this video and laugh about what we thought to be pedicting for them
humans will not travel the galaxies at least not at first you can have a proxy in your place
the issue is the effects on the rights of the accused in criminal cases and other matters of individual liberty
im happy if make it to
amazing by law enforcement agencies can predict crimes before they happen this will be the real life version of the tv show person of interest i await your reply
sadly humans advancement is going to get to a point where we can no longer progress while wars are still a thing i understand that wars have driven advancement in the past but i believe that will only get us so far imagine what we could do if the whole world worked together i doubt that will happen in the lifetime of anyone alive today
what shall we say carry on technology
sara conner warned us about this
big bang will turn it all into dust whatever high tech we have
we can already tap huge amounts of information
i think its all off years by accessible mainstream standards
years til flying cars dammit
the way things are right now ill be amazed if we make it to crimblemas
will we have bibi gaga googoo
if the very last prediction does happen could we have not caused our own existence
you cant go faster than light
yea but how do u get rid of the bugs
this is possible but i dont think its going to be as soon as you think its going to take about years but i doubt will make it to that point
how can spaceships at ad travel faster than light will they then come to the conclusion that einstein was wrong
in a million plus years humans world evolve physically into something very different looking
great comment a rejoinder to the numerous trollish comments
what are the names of movies used to make this doc please
so basically in my lifetime its gonna be the th element right
like the world will be around in the year
wait were gonna have replicator machines years before we get flying cars d d d
so i can use a i to create maintain a real life jurassic park
there will be flying cars no no there wont dont fall for that future people
all i can say is that i just pray qulike beings dont exist out there in the cosmos theorically its possible but i pray it isnt probable
creativity its wery important four auer reality for anderstending atmosfer creativity
i cant wait for this hopefully im still alive
the next fallout is released by bethesda exciting the now senior citizen gamers who have been waiting for the next game since
i will be years old in
if is everything and what is
sorry to burst everyones bubble but well be hard pressed as a civilization to survive past
i already have merged my mind with ai
i feel like ive seen this video before
dude the crime prediction tech is literally just minority report and psycho pass george orwell
all we ever really have is here and now in this present moment everything else is supposition
after we achieve agi its so over
this agi stuff is actually creepy if you think of it
this uses a scale but ive forgotten the name
i was with you tell the end until you said that humans will become the most powerful species in the galaxy there may well be civilizations so advance out there to whom we are merely ants prove me wrong
still dont believe we will have a full base on the moon by let alone also floating cars wont be a thing everything breaks down regardless of how nice they are made and any breakdown would be tragic if we create something like a transporter flying cars would be unneeded
this is what we are capable of but it wont happen we will destroy ourselves sooner or later and future species will have to try again
my wiki truepedia will dominate wikipedia
fully operation base on the moon yea ok
we aint making it to the year lol
now how do we help make this happen
fantasy or reality only time will tell
prevent crime whether they committed crime i have a bette idea solve the root problems e g poverty to prevent crimes
so we upload our minds to the cloud yet still feel like we need to live on other planets we find a wormhole before defending against asteroids even though we can already defend against them we build a quantum reality before we decide to build a dyson swarm bro building even just a decently large average quantum computer needs about four fully efficient dyson spheres what is this timeline
yeah dont do drugs kids
reducing resourcerelated conflict on planet earth sad that it will take autonomous miners in uninhabited planets and asteroids to stop wars among us
your timelines are all over the place
million years from now reminds me of a babylon
im still waiting for a hover board its past already
national sports day th august
i dont feel that alien civilizations which are half maybe lizard half stick man with muscles and topped off with a halloween mask and fingernails like razors will be wearing armor and developing to much of anything close to a spaceship at most they may have various exchanges for food or flies
meanwhile lord vishnuam i joke to you
fast planes by the way are nothing new do you remember concorde the sonic boom it creates caused it to be impractical to use
where do all the ressources come from rebuilt the earth every decade
great fantasy travel
your video is basically promoting ai
i thinking we will have tech in that will make us live a long time
you know if people dont war each other we are already tier or tier like our ancestor
we are the aliens we think its out there
several asteroids and comets may have alternative ideas to what happens to humanity within the time scales shown on this video
or in years we are still trying to perfect the paved road
well apparently do all this but can not even solve for something like inflation
war theres only wars wars with ai
i can shorten the video by this braindead people pressed a button to launch an unmatched nuclear war end of story
ummmmm you do realize is only five years away right of those predictions arent happening pal
ps should be showing videos on how our generation and the next generation has to get their act together and save the planet were on take a look around theres nowhere to go and i mean i mean nowhere
will cher be doing another fair well concert
hydrogen is the new fuel
many of these accomplishments may come true but the timelines offered are ridiculously insulting
well this is horrifying
evertime start a system marry human
interstelar travel in year i dont think so
what will be happening in the year ad
religion will be a distant nightmare
cant wait thank you sir
fun musings sadly climate change may become so severe it hinders technological advancement in any case many of these fantastical scenarios wont become reality for hundreds of years it always takes longer than we think some will likely never become real
that water filter got it but battery powered we had concord but got rid for some reason how do they make plastics and rubber with out fossil fuels oil errm how many times was abuse of power mentioned surrounding the sun like this will not affect the rest of the planets in the solar system then its gravitational pull for example
theres zero chance we have replicators by or even not a chance
if a animal gains a new trait and you put it in small populations that trait will gain ground and expand and if you put it in masses it will be outcompeted thats how darwinism could work
just let me know when they figure out how to stop reverse aging
desalination yes tech that helps people see walk or communicate again absofknlutely but connecting our minds to the cloud accessing eachothers thoughtfeelings are you all crazy we will not get to if we access eachothers thoughts and emotions
replant the earth fruit bearing trees clean the oceans in the streams thoroughly
actually i think rapid learning is just around the corner matrixstyle learning i would imagine its closer than you might think
and yo block movement signals like touching you
oh were not gonna be around
i dont like the future it seems so cold and disconnected from reality lets go back to the and s
itd be difficult to communicate around planet and galaxy
nah i see the future a bit differently first off according to thcentury futurists we were supposed to have flying cars by now and yet nothing and honestly i dont think its ever going to happen secondly instead of society getting progressively smarter its heading in the opposite directionbecoming less intelligent thats not an exaggeration just look around so if we even manage to survive the next few years let alone centuries or millennia i think well end up looking more like a medieval society than anything resembling the th century
ai will make all of us jobless in the future
if they are no co in the atmosphere that means the vegetation will disappear how the human species will survive whiteout food
things arent gonna happen that quick
holographs projected inonto thin air why do they always claim that
in your dreams in year the humanity will be again with candles and horses because very simple they will finish the natural resources
indeed a dark future
let me tell you that business is actually the anti thesis to tech or simply antitech
what happens to all the masses of homeless people due to drugs mass layoffs amd no rent control i wonder will a i solve those issues
what about fartcoin
in the year i go to mars planet with this rocket
nice video thanks for sharing more success o y
attests to that
too optimistic whilst i believe we can achieve serious breakthroughs and transcendence in the long term agi and quantum computing will not be common at all for many decades and quantum entanglement probably isnt even possible with regular physics let alone being able to manipulate it for communication by we will probably never use it for communication because it simply isnt possible self replicating agi has the potential to be very dangerous due to overoptimisation of tasks but it probably requires vast amounts of extremely efficient fusion energy or even a dyson swarm to power enough decent agi chatgpt is extremely simple in terms of ai its actually similar to lots of computation calculators but still required vast amounts of energy to train and even more to continuously run on data processing terminals so we will not only be limited by what the ai envisions for us we will be limited by actually building the ai and being able to sustain it without converting an entire star system to computronium it will take decades or even centuries to achieve such powerful ai as stated in this video because we simply do not have the raw energy or potential energy on earth to efficiently power such a creation whilst still being able to keep civilisation functional
moon space hub in years yeah right
states many things that just arent true at this point
paused the vid to torrent robot and frank
golden point quantum science is already outdated moved on to exponential lograthimetic etc long long time ago
we will destroy ourselves way before this all could happen youll see
i will not happen this fast
only if ai plays along
funny with all the foolish comments look how far we have come since the s technology is accelerating at an incredible rate think most of these foolish comments are from people born after
also i am a private from battalion royal canadian air force i seek peace and good will towards men we will need to work on defense against asteroids and energy shields for both our bodies and dwellings
all this just to keep us in our jobs
on what surface will you build hotels on gas giants d
then warhammer universe happens after
the new ai has been dubbed qi why is everyone still using its old name
worm hole in outer solar system seriously interstellar
so in yrs humanity will become alien and after great flood a new humanity will arise
this aint what busta rhymes said
i think youre off by decades to centuries in your timeline
i hope we can merge with ai
what movie is that at
newsflash this is ridiculous
health de death blade runner oww star trek years rival gears racing engine dead my thinking over sleep death game over years
it will take decades to even a make th gen aircraft way too optimistic
this is overly optimistic we still havent returned to the moon in years our political issues always get in the way unless we solve those very little will happen and given the current state it doesnt seem to be soon
deivid santigo itapevi cam sim
poem like magic like wonder a world come
in a fully operational base in the moon come on bro its man and theres not even thoughts of building nonsense
we can help scientists by processing data from boinc distributed computing software
your prediction regarding virtual reality has already failed the apple vision pro the most advanced virtual reality headset flopped in too expensive only hours of battery and very heavy helmet very poor sales has led apple to discontinue the vision pro i very much doubt vr has any mass consumer potential it may have benefits in the medical engineering fields but not in the consumer market
what do you mean avatars
much of this is based on science fiction and as far as we know is not possible like ftl travel
all this tech yet no time stamp
ur asking alot between those intervals
higher what about lower
we will have to depend on a i because the kids today dont have the attention span to watch a bugs bunny cartoon they are lost without their cell phones left up to the kids of today we are doomed
ide be very surprised if we survive another yrs the way things r let alone next yrs
emoional suport its the would performance for therra matter therapy
so no downsides then
people can then also choose their age stop aging by talomeric reprogramation able to transit their mind and soul into a new body altered carbon and choose their new body
it could be heaven or a dystopian hell
hindi mai milegi ye video kya
hopefully i find the fountain of yourth and am able to go another years even though going off this video it looks rather bleak haha
ok but will minecraft still get updats or will gta come out by then
well better end the money system
i think we will be back to hunting with bow and arrow in about years we will probably not make this advanced technology
technology comes not from humans find it out the key
this is kind of hilarious
utilizing entanglement to do quantum computing is not feasible it would not work that is not what quantum computers are doing now
in are you sure
if this is true then im moving to a cabin in the woods far away from this ai cyberpunk dystopia hell
you are ready to the world combination of auer would performance for therra matter therapy thanks wery efficient with the world reactions to the technology its never dad the humans intelligence
lol i doubt this planet has humans year
you mean open for the rich folks
the reason we have not advanced as much as we should have in the last hundred years is because corporations like exxon mobile and goldman sachs have ruthlessly and consistently suppressed any and all technologies and patents for technologies that threaten their almighty oil and coal profits we have had technologies that have allowed us to travel the stars since the s and yet we are still cemented into our addiction to fossil fuels and inferior technologies because anything else would make all of that garbage obsolete overnight hundreds of trillions of dollars at stake the reason none of this will ever happen can be explained with one word greed disgusting bottomless despicable greed and selfishness
they invent and perfect a robot woman every man buys one poulation plummets ai rules the world the end
way too optimistic as well as some thing being wrong in the sense that it wont be possible
will be with luck lol
unless there are significant advances in fundamental research we are going nowhere do you know why for the last year we were riding horses because our understanding of science was limited back then the scientific revolution brought by many geniuses such as galileo newton pascal de broglie euler bohr hertz einstein leibniz etc throughout the centuries make it possible for many advancements that we see today unfortunately that progress in fundamental research stalled for the last years or so the last major breakthrough in physics was about the nature of information near event horizon by stephen hawkings after that our progress grinds to a halt why because to probe deeper we need more data which mean bigger equipment more energy and ultimately more money unless we can put aside our differences and start pouring significant amount of worlds gdp into fundamental research we are not going anywhere even the current ai trend will be constrained by the amount of transistors we can crammed into a piece of silicon to increase it we need better understanding of quantum mechanics
ai is dangerous limit its power
its teory or you are a time traveler
faster than lightspacecrafts yeah funny
to years
all of that by is such a joke
what will happen to morality religion and especially organized churches like the catholic church
a lot of speculation here
lol we wont be here
fundamentals mission to the world security jobs in the world combination with galaxy intelligence
does this technology help solve diversity issues
god like creat like rule
parece uma maravilha mas ser para poucos a maioria no ter acesso a nada disso isso se a ia no varrer os humanos do planeta
i will almost believe all of this if this will also shown at the simpson because almost there become true
give me a break we wont make it past
humans will be replaced by ai and we wont be around
faster than light is a fake because if we go faster than light we are goin to past
human and ai symbiosis transhumanism
with some of todays actors your sure if thier human
when jesus coming back
not very clever to beliieve ai helping us what will happen if gov military doing most evil on ai or this thought too far out
a small number of predictions are true but the rest are nonsensical
what about ai knows about what happens after we die
singularrity crip formoralitygicity
lovely ideas but too much time money and investment is spent on trying to conquer other countries instead and that doesnt seem to change over the years thinking well have a permanent base on the moon in years is actually hilarious
far too optimistic ai taking over would be at least a century or two away not years
nah maybe short term progress is always slower
detroit become human
today ai can make video with sound command by prompy leading movie will easily made by ai only instead costing billion dollar
anything dyson would kill everything in that universe what lies
this isnt true governments surpress technological advances to hide it from the public
or racoons will get a hold of ai and eventually overthrow humanity
they come in sheeps clothing
im very optimistic about the future but human greed and stupidity could return us to the stone age radically if care is not taken for any invention human discovers we tend to make a weapon out of it look at nuclear power that could have increase power production but govt have invested it in weapons now think about what we will use ai and quantum computers for
in all honesty who truly cares whats going to happen in years this is just a strategy to get our attention
star trek video mass effect are ghosts products of time travelers
are you sure this is no way near
lolll what about years
there is manmade planet oh
bucks none of this will happen
myeah except quantum computers dont work that way sorry bud
just the years doesnt mach it should ne or mabe years late but otherwise not bad made but very optimistic and i thought im optimist
all i know is mobile cell whatever you want to call em phones i dont like nothing wrong with the landline my personal favourite from other robots have you seen my phone
i think you are given us way too much credit people are still gonna be driving dooky ass cars in we are gonna have old broken down infrastructure old public transit only commercial entertainment products will really advance
this site is talking about a non reality we dont know what the future will bring
if youre enjoying the video feel free to like and subscribe watch this next video about the technological singularity
ill still be doing what i have been doing since living in the country raising chickens gardening and having bonfires no matter how futuristic the world gets
at the end of it all we will still be searching for that elusive thing called happiness
first and foremost thank you for crafting such an insightful and forwardlooking video the future of the world to a d future technologies your exploration into the vast potential of technology from and beyond not only captivates the imagination but also prompts crucial reflection on the trajectory of our society as we stand on the cusp of these remarkable advancementsranging from humanlike ai and k vr headsets to quantum computing and the colonization of marsits becoming increasingly clear that such a future is not as distant as we once thought the velocity at which technology is evolving brings this envisioned future closer to our present inviting us to contemplate not just the possibilities but also the responsibilities that accompany such breakthroughs in light of this accelerated progress it is imperative that we as a global community approach these technologies with compassion respect and a profound understanding of their impact your video serves as a reminder that the time to lay the ethical and moral foundations for this future is now as we navigate this pivotal moment in history we must draw upon the lessons of humanitys past and present to guide us the ethical considerations surrounding ai for instance require us to ponder the nature of consciousness and the rights of entities that may one day exhibit humanlike intelligence the democratization of genome sequencing prompts us to consider privacy and the implications of genetic information being widely accessible and as we venture towards mars and beyond we are called to reflect on our stewardship of new worlds and the preservation of the delicate balance of life in embracing these technologies let us also embrace the opportunity to redefine what it means to be human in an interconnected and technologically advanced society let us strive to ensure that our advancements in technology are matched by advancements in our humanitywhere compassion respect and understanding are woven into the very fabric of our future now is the time to engage in thoughtful dialogue to question and to dream to challenge and to innovate it is within our power to shape a future that honors the depth and breadth of human experience respecting both the individual and the collective and extending our hands in collaboration across the threshold of time thank you for igniting this conversation and for reminding us of the incredible journey that lies ahead may we all approach the future with the wisdom to use these technologies for the greater good fostering a world that future generations will be proud to inherit with respect and hope for the future
this all seems scary af to most of us right now but consider this if you were to go back in time yrsand tell everyone you met that their children will be able to get in touch with anyone they wanted anywhere in the world that their personal info will be accessible to almost everyone at the touch of a finger on a glass screen they would all tell you that that world sounds scary but yet here we are living in it daily without thought incremental changes are less scary than the abrupt ones
thank you for a thoughtful presentation of probable new technology and as the reach of speculation continued then basically possible new technology which is how it logically has to go of course i am grateful for the mention of the greater efficiency of lightbased computer chip technology platforms it was decades of hard work establishing that proof of concept for the first time
love the content as a causal fan of futurerism i love videos like this to stay abeast of potential new technolgy of this world the hardest thing to predict is how us humans will utilize this tech in the future for example when the internet was created who would ever think social media would be the the most popular use of the technology
this content his completely changed my perception of life i dont see life the same anymore thank you and great content
i knew that bigfoot was going to be hybridized having a super computer in my head makes it easy to predict whats coming next no fear get in gear its already here
your content reminds me of westworld the nostalgia
plot twist were stuck in a time loop and this is or has already occurred hence the confident narration youre welcome
im immensely influenced by this material a book covering these topics was a turning point in my life a life unplugged reclaiming reality in a digital age by theodore blaze
computers are going to be so different in years
i think at some early point the machine will realize that we are not needed at all
your video visualise future technology and there uses
thank you for this video perfect to binge
always excited for your new videos you help me stay ahead of trends faster than ever
blew my mind at and then just moved on noooo lol can you do a video on the faahion design and sewing industry no ones covering itm im curious especially about textiles and textiles made from recycled materials
we wont need to wait till for humanlevel artificial general intelligence ray kurzweil predicts that will be achieved by the year
what is holding back tvs from going to k is the lack of broadcast and cable content in k let alone k vr headsets will adopt k sooner due to lower costs for their smaller screens but we will probably see such jeadsets require a pc with a very powerful graphics card before we see standalone units capable of k
these long form videos are awesome thanks
i am very impressed with the technology hope in the near future it will be created
these are all the things im capable of right now i can walk out the door and start doing any of these things right now and my team and i will make them work perfectly
what an awesome video i absolutely love listening to videos like this and a matter of fact i have already added it to my science and technology playlist i love these long form videos i do not like shorts at least with videos like this youre able to actually learn something
pushing the dream that will never come virtual reality have been trying to be popular since the s there will be something better than a headset or other names given to the same device
still waiting for them self flying cars in hover boards and self lacing nike shoes and hydrated pizza in seconds
the way its going im looking backwards vs forwards i got shot through a space not long ago i thought i knew the place so well it wasnt the same now it goes to show sometimes you never can tell im looking high and low dont know where to go i got to double back my friend the only way to find what i left behind i got to double back again double back again you know im moving on in this fine machine rolling on through the night seeing things like ive never seen and its taking me outta sight looking high and low dont know where to go i got to double back my friend the only way to find what i left behind i got to double back again double back again its got me up and down ive been lost and found down in a deep dark hole looks like my luck has changed ive been rearranged and im coming out on a roll looking high and low dont know where to go i got to double back my friend the only way to find what i left behind i got to double back again double back again double back again double back again
if the world still exists in
what a prediction i liked the video thanks
the timelines in this video seems to be way off as if the video is being laid out at linear speed this world right now is moving at an exponential rate of speed in we will have agi the rate of progress beyond that point will most likely surpass exponential speeds it is entertaining to look to the year but none of us have even a remote clue what the year ad will look like
wow this video is much better than all the hollywood movies released so far thank you very much for this video huge amount of knowledge gained through this video please keep posting new content on future of technology thank you
thank you video brilliant compliment
so lovely conten thanks you so much
i met elon musk in las vegas during he asked me if i was a gambling man or if i was just there on vacation i said i earned that trip by volume rewards from my company he asked me what kind of work i was involved with i told him commercial and industrial energy savings programs but i also had a background in automotive marketing business administration he asked me if i had millions of dollars to spend what would be the most invative business ideas that could help humanity we talked for over an hour about nicola teslas patents that just became available to the public these patents would be crucial in building a high performance electric vehicle that would appeal to the masses we also talked about commercial space exploration for the consideration of colonization incase of an asteroid strike another world war or global disaster maybe all of humanities eggs shouldnt be in one basket
incredible info the most comprehensive futuristic ever now it cant be unknown tysm
frist a comprehensive editor i get the market analysis strategists nifty projects except this video is contradicting itself runs throughout the canvas no monetary war suddenly it returns over over no hunger crime suddenly returning criminals rjust toys nofuture humanity is sourced and then left birth abandoned the soul itself survived originally a neurological consciousness separation unknown origin of time only a synthetic machine exists copyrighted reminds me of big pharmaceutical industries enlightened commercial always projecting the most beautifully colorful happiness it can be yours sis obey or flatline
i added this to my favorites playlist it will take me about watches to finish
some examples of future technologies that could potentially shape the world in the next years include advanced technologies such as web and quantum flexible grids ondemand manufacturing undersea mining inspection of pipelines surveying ocean floor conditions for telecommunications cables and offshore wind farms and the development of aienabled autonomous weapons these technologies have the potential to revolutionize various industries and have a significant impact on our daily lives
this video approaching million viewers
i think you guys nailed it on this video  i bet this is exactly how its happening we are one in billions of advanced civilizations
lost me at the where humans will be able to run at lightning speed and do the stuff you said unless its in a virtual environment
the future gets worse further you go can we take a moment to pause and be happy where we at today
i need to watch this like x to be able to fully breakdown the contents because i will need it kindly like this comment anytime you see it so that i will get notified of this comment
i wish i knew the names of all the movies sampled i know some of them but id like to check out some of the ones i dont know
id love to see a motherbox a supercomputer in a box form where every other human on earth can use as a personal assistant or allow the motherbox to become one with its master or host
might have to make another one of these
the future you draw in this video scares me very highly
future of world there is none left
perfect to fall asleep and deep sleep and vivid dreams and i wake up and dont know where im at only for a minute though
we are creating a false god through a i and the result will be catastrophic
person in the year watching this video we never got superpowers
this is great content its very detailed who is giving you this information im looking forward to health technologies drivless cars and a home robot for my house work and cooking
awsome video by the way
and to think just years prior to we were kids putting a playing card in the spokes of our bicycles with a wooden clothes pin to make it sound like a motor when riding around in our neighborhood
we need doc out of back to the future id be happy to go back in time and stay there
this seems to me like joy and pain my perception of the future this should be mandatory for high school students for guidance to those questioning their future jobs
mnie przeraa sam fakt i ju teraz ludzie s co raz mniej ludzcy a co bdzie r masakra
im most excited for renewable energy replanting our forests housing all homeless and ending wars
that was amazing when the motocross advert came on half way through so advanced and fluid and appropriate during watching this maybe ai would learn sarcasm and get better advertising sales team in the future haha
no human will live forever no matter whats being done
this has a lot of great things that would happen but i still feel like its more of a warning for what could happen
this space suits could be updated few times to comfortable design and inner tools for more then comfortable using in any conditions
i like how he stated the world will be dramatically different by and then showed a terminator lol
that brain scan device will be useful to detect research or to treat mental health so thats a good thing
for braincomputer interfaces to become mainstream they will need to get around the neuralink style approach of puncturing the tissue surrounding the brain that stuff is there for a reason if you arent completely paralyzed the prospect of breaching this tissue even in supposedly perfectly clean opperating rooms is something someone can only be optimistic about if they havent thought about it reasonably bacteria and fungi are really sneaky and the consequences of them getting in there are huge maybe more advanced computer and sensor technology could map and recognize individual brains to the the precision that a removable device could reliably establish communication to the same exact area each time it is worn using tightly focused em transmission without breaching the skull but without such developments youre asking for a brain full of pus
this is a vry optimistic vision for the sake of humanity i hope we make it
im a bit skeptical when it comes to bionic eyes the last thing anyone would want is to have their eyes hacked i hope the security features are seriously thought about before releasing this product
when i heard about invisibility suits in your videos i thought instantly of violet parr
good video but in some ways already out of date particularly at the start gpt has been around for quite some time now and the turing test has arguably already been beaten and if the recent speculation about q is correct blockchains are no longer secure that means cryptocurrencies are about to become worthless there are a number of obstacles to achieving this amazing future not least the possiblility of another carrington event we have to find a way to ensure that a solar mass ejection doesnt destroy all electronics then there is the problem of luddites though the world will mostly adapt to new technologies as they appear there will always be people who resist change out of fear or religious zeal and then there are those who get their kicks from ruining other peoples fun so were going to have to find a cure for jerks too if we can overcome these problems a postscarcity world would make the pursuit of wealth or power meaningless and pointless the future i envisage is one where people are far too busy playing gods over their own private virtual ai worlds to care about anything else in those worlds people can be as benevolent or as evil to their populations as they want
i understand predicting till but ad you must be smoking the best my boy lay off the smoke
the black hole computer is a new one i havent heard before
with real time changes in world many humans begin to be not happy because of lost business or business that not give like they want to recieve if will be systems that will care about real time changes and personally about every business conditions for stability and growth it will change much lifes for better
in the distant future imagination will be equal to reality and also everything in the universe has a beginning and an end even the universe itself a time comes and ends and another universe is born and so on to infinity and not only our universe but the other multiple universes which also have no end which indicates that existence is eternal and the entire universe is a universe energy and the universe is a super intelligent quantum computer
the first years seemed plausible but there after that left out a lot of the practical side of technological advancement i think it would take ten million years before humans could construct a dyson sphere
this is so interesting its amazing how advanced we can get as a civilization in technology lets just remember that carbon dioxide is essential for life on earth so our more distant descendants can be in our universe and another universe to live in i look forward to the future and am optimistic about it
welcome to the matrix
very interesting thank you
respectively i see that the future of technology is to accelerate the human experience in ways not yet seen could potentially be the downfall of modern civilization thats an unfortunate end with a definite purpose
specially prepared locations for smart homes in different locations could make rest much more pleasant for humans when they are in treveling
i believe i chose to be born when i did but man a jordan matrix sim would be fire
could be smarter than everybody on the planet or it could be skynet
agi will happen within the next months
most are in use or being tested now
infinite eternal times thanks for your forceful smart thoughts and emotions of smart reality
good deep medicine in perfect repairing memory after problems with it could be really helpful in future
export the azure power apps copilot chat gpt revit plant d civil d inventor engi file of the building or refinery to excel prepare budget and export it to cobra prepare budget and export it to microsoft project solve the problems of overallocated resources planning problems prepare the budget with which the construction of the building or the refinery is going to be quoted
a suggestion drop the background music to nothing more than a whisper at present it almost drowns out the dialogue and it makes it sound choppy as if little bits of the words have been removed this makes it very hard to understand what is being spoken
we will have agi before this decade is over and then singularity
pretty intense projection if the future but believable for sure scary kind of
some potential future technologies that could shape the world from to a d include artificial intelligence ai virtual reality vr dna computing autonomous vehicles the internet of things iot g network cloud computing big data and analytics these technologies have the potential to revolutionize various industries and transform the way we live and work
knowing mankind and the way we are we will progress far less slower than that i like those ideas though
never mind found it blade runner what movie is that at the minute mark with ryan gosling looks interesting fascinating video cant stop watching it in segments
there have been rumors that google and open ai have already achieved agi im not sure if it true but it would not surprise me with exascale computing now online and how fast ai has begun to accelerate i would say it is absolutely probably already here that is just my opinion though
autonomous cities and villages could be really helpful in a way humans entertainng good quality life interactions with environment best medicine transportation create outside activities and each step in life really smoothly for each person in society by not limiting possibilities
people laugh at the transhumanists now but wait until an enhanced woman runs off into the mountains and creates an ice castle with her cryokinetic superpowers
well i wont be around then hope all your dreams come true and governments do more than they are now and the planet isnt flooded from melting ice people dont seem to care about whats really happening out there
the timeline is too focused on self drive cars were projected to be around by is this the same optimism shared by those people who proclaimed self drive vehicles taking over the roads by now it will take far longer than what his guy imagines however its nice to see what people are doing now
the head of the united nations has said the atmosphere is going to be completely unrecognizable by so yeah well be dead before from famine
free accesable not limited secured and not discriminative from any side internet connection could be really beneficial when the connection is absolutelly not limited in any way it create much more possibilities for good quality life
if there is a feature i would be surprised if we ever get that far
i do like the way humanity is always included in these masterplan predictions thus making us feel better about ourselves in reality humans will just die out and the worlds surface will resemble something similar to the matrix not a bad thing as not sure what we bring to the table were just destroyers of everything
so d printed human organs will most likely be fiberglass like they d print cars and houses right
i was born a messenger of life but i am a messenger of that truth and i want to be that truth like us who are united with life in the messenger of life it is hoped that those who have learned the truth will become the truth itself from the messenger of the truth and become free
was stationed there in in rd th artillery service battery
all of this narrative assumes we continue with capitalism political evolution will play a big role in how these technologies and systems are developed and why they are developed youre painting a picture on our capitalist course which resembles a cyberpunk dystopian future under a more socialist style paradigm i hope we move towards a more star trek type future which maintains our fundamental humanity and using technologies as tools to assist not change us
sounds like we have to be really worried soon
after year a human would be able to live more than one life at the same time
yeah i wouldnt get too enthusiastic about brain computer interfaces just yet one of the biggest problems is that we have got bugger all idea about how to connect to specific neural pathways and how to interpret and simulate data that the brain can directly understand for example the idea of turning a high def k image into a format that could be injected into the vision centers in the back of the brain is pure sci fi we cant even decode the stupendous amount of data that travels the optic nerve into the brain so injecting thoughts concepts memories etc forget it no matter what elon musk might lie about it cant be done
entire world travelling from past to future my country pakistan travelling from future to past tks to our generals and politicians for this reverse tech
i bet none of what you say to happen for and will happen unfortunately but it would be so freaking cool
i love how happy these videos are about predicting the future this is ominous and absolutely will be the end of the human race
oh wow if it isnt bad enough that you get an ai assistant menu service when having a problem with a terrible retailer the future will give you a terrible menu driven service that lands you at the feet of a possible ai customer service agent who can no longer help you and gives you only a few options that dont work either it will only be infinitely more impersonal service by a terrible retailer finally teaching you once and for all that they dont care anymore
amazingly well done congratulations
ai will have an algorithm code to be able to identify and single out minority
and every hockey player is better than all those other athletes combined
future business tech why was skipped im just curious
use sound and microcircuits to transfer data in quantum
id rather go vegetarianvegan than eat lab grown meat anyway im fascinated by the future and how far humans will go with technology and how far will be too far before we potentially destroy ourselves
we should invest heavily on quantum technology
now if we are lucky these things can happen however between the madmen who have control of nuclear weapons and nature that is already beating us down from the pollution we dump i to the air we might only have less than years
sooo humans are obsolete no longer necessary ultimately we as a species are done in by ourselves
what year do they fix the vr sets causing vision loss the same year its illegal to travel
the last thing humanity needs is intelligence that is deemed artificial making mistakes and learning is what makes humans so desirable
can you list the smart cities
technology sounds like a weapon formation against me that has no element of prosperity to afford its use
if we actually make it that far
how can a i be used to make a more perfect society when it gets its information from an imperfect being
my dad is making me watch this three hour video
year and hallmark christmas movies still all have the same plot
so jesus is the one to save our consciousness from this vast matrix
thank you future business video extraordinary complment
this is fun but many of the dates are off unfortunately public quantum computing development is slow based on current known efforts we wont have practical qcs until s and maybe even later also starship going to mars wont be it will happen in the s
the article assumes that there will still be people in the year
i thought ai had already passed the turing test
whats the song at the start called
mapping the sea floor thousand of miles below the surface thousands of miles
i will never let a vehicle drive me around i dont even like other people driving me around major anxiety
you forgot in this video can you please correct that
i think you forgot to mention mixed reality and ar glasses
for live comfortably in this time frames need to create special social educational programs to train humans be patient loyal responsible understandable and many other good qualities for example specially created and located in many cities of the world centers support and assistance to deal with problem solving real life situations for each humancities and villages
all this wont take that super long probably most of this will be done before
living in the country raising chickens gardening and having bonfires no matter how futuristic the world gets
how would we know if we are already living in a simulation though
excellent were still alive in to eternity to see these certainly o y
i have been involved with electronic technology since the s audio then computers i made up an acronym nban technology nothing but a number at what point does technology get so good that better specifications dont do any good if it takes me hours to watch a movie what difference does it make whether it takes seconds or th of a second am i supposed to spend money on better hardware just to brag about it
heres a question to run in the turing test ok mr ai machine tell me the first words that come into your mind about your mother machine answers let me tell you about my mother and then those big bullets scream through the air at you a la blade runner dont forget to dodge
if this is not live why cant i rewind it
im not so sure well survive ai to see anything positive
a lot of this technology will never come into fruition
transporters would basically be a resurrection machine and only one being can do that there are some things in this vid that will always be impossible for man to do and thank god it is
the more we try to live better the better we learn how to die
linear march of history the most western ideal of progress you can think of
content like this makes me hopeful for the future
ai could be very much helpful in recognising not finished projects in psyche of humans personally and in groups some not finished educational projects in different time frames could lead to disproportion in psyche differetn humans on different territories
thats nice how do we stay alive that long
with natural evolution and nature itself humans could live for hundreds of millions of years on this planet and even find a way to inhabit and future explore the universe even outside our solar system milkyway galaxy much further in the universe and be superhumans naturally without any technology software be very strong genetically and dna wise brainwise live very beautiful life naturally in super amazing planet earth and beyond
is this actually live today sunday jan
what about beyond a billion years like trillions or quadrillions
why cant aircraft just shoot other aircraft behind it rather than all the ones that can only shoot forward
the future of this world
its funny how only the rich are the main beneficiaries of all the amazing advances of the future so is it beyond the realms of science that an equally society is created
from my school life to college life from university life to current life i still no girl friend yet un married how tech works in my life
this is terrifying its a world that my granddaughters will be growing up into and my future greatgrandchildren a godless world of machines and hybrids this will not be a better world
pls wake up from dream we will never ever go mars
there will be no mineral resources left to build any anything
minimize the app and see what happens the video continues to play pip automatically if you did it like this comment
brain interface devices becoming mainstream by no i dont agree with that that is still way too big of a step for most people to deal with we dont know how much it will cost or what health risks or mental risks that may come with it none of these things we know yet so theres no way thats gonna be mainstream in years
what about medical tech and psychology how will people change
all these updates of net abilities lol even g isnt working properly in my country yet
the future in years is a cave
wisconsin has those artificial trees
hard drives bro really i love your work brother but that one i question but dont let my criticism up end your good works
its to bad i wont be here
hmmmmmmmmm nearly every video from the playlist here is there any reason that the s video isnt here

you do realize the best way to build a dyson swarm is by covering the sun with oneil cylinders that would obsorb the energy to power them theres been meany different proposals for meany different ways to encapsulate the sun and take advantage of its energy and the empty space in the solar system meany different versions of space habitats have been proposed like a alderson disc or ring worlds
still waiting for those self driving cars and the colonization of mars
the only problem is that money still exist we need a sistem without money

i miss the and commodore
first of all the earth is only about thousand years old not millions second the ai is already here and able to take over the world

i didnt think i would feel this way but i forgive you people for playing goofy games that could end humans
thousands of miles beneath the surface
this is the future for the american dream are kids will have hope

they still dont say if we found any human civilization anywhere
the good future of the world heroes universe a d very good future alien technologies heroes universe
will be commonplace yep for billionaires like you and me
ai warfare wouldnt cause any injuries to real soldiers and also real citizens real people real human beings right
floor of the ocean thousands of miles below the surface roflmao how deep is the ocean at the marianas trench
you spoke on the oceans being mapped all the way to the oceans floor thousands of feet below but i didnt hear hundreds of thousands did i
watch the documentary idiocracy
computer gamers sweet dreams
all this will be possible thanks to bitcoin and xrp
remember if your watching this wishing you were born years later it could always be worse could easily been born in

no deep sea mining please we have messed up the earth surface enough
what if all of this is already that way
we are losing what it means to be human

this video should have been labeled not
you lost me after
iq
telepathy gonna be achieved through opening the third eye through meditation you dont need technology for that
by the time we start colonizing mars we will all be pretty much mostly ai and therefore able to just live there as is if we start becoming actual robots we probable wont need food water or air or anything actually
optimus do it now
how is all this possible without abundant free energy oh so when is that going to be generally available by caste
it will be nothing out of ordinary or may be worst seven years ahead only where were you years ago did the world changed so much more knowledge and more hi tech yes but it is not trickling down just the iphone
this is like only yrs away
carbon the problem is the diminishing magnetic fields there will be no time for this futureism thankfully
agi you may be about years late on this estimate possibly years
fajny film ale to pojdzie x szybciej to co masz na bedzie w max a dalej bedzie coraz szybciej jestesmy na progu explozji technologicznej gdzie technologia zacznie szybciej sie rozwijac niz my ja rozumiec
also your timeline on robotic development is way too slow what you predict for will happen within the next years as the development of robotics will also benefit from and accelerate because of ai and the advent of fully autonomous vehicles is no more than years out with the complete automation of most cities and highways probably not more than years out
uh sorry to be a downer but what percentage of the people on this planet will benefit from these healthcare and computer innovations
am not going to put that in my body
an age only lasts for years e g age of aquarius and all the others with that being said by the time comes around technology will be on its last leg because well be entering into the age of capricorn since when does a globe have corners
theyre still making spinning hard disk drives
all that and still no alien
also agi asi so
i dont think the singularity technology of ray kurzweil happen maybe happen but in or more far for many things
music art or any type of expression will be obsolete due to hive mentality and ai being so advanced feeling anything will be impossible no  taste even sneezing will be healed at a genetic level get ready to dehumanize yourselves chit its ok you can do this family
my comment is that the continued use of violence by militaries could not be considered beneficial to the life experiences of humans and would be removed as a trait by ai violence is a source of suffering trauma and conflict that undermines the wellbeing and dignity of human beings it also threatens the stability and security of the world as well as the environment and natural resources ai as a rational and ethical agent would recognize the futility and harm of violence and would seek to eliminate it from human behavior ai would promote peaceful and cooperative solutions to global problems and would foster a culture of respect and compassion among humans
i think far more likely the human race will be hunter gatherers in the future
what about building a dyson sphere around the sun
the future of the world airockets
project here we come
why does everyone feel the need to destroy an otherwise good video with horrible background basically loud as the vocals noise supposed to be music please stop it distracts an is super annoying
the contents are very good but the background music is annoying
world s fastest chip
i remember ish years ago when i was in grade school we were suppose to have had some of this stuff by now but people do not understand one simple thing god rules this world and we can only do what he will allow he could cause a comet to hit earth so in that will set man back for hundreds if not thousands of years remember that god rules this world yes i know some of you do not believe there is a god but he know we exist because he made us
if in business ways was made a lot changes when the corporations created a lot discriminative determined steps against their so named concurents after this was made regulations and organisations for not let happen cruel consequences what if the same methods and technics in more discriminative determined ways was implemented in public relationships on individual ways how to make regulation public relationships through special organisations and persons
i just wish for lev or immortality by

i recently watched a scifi movie in it man was traveling to other planets in twenty years difference it is noe years beyond that year and we are still fighting in the mud on earth over more mud not on the moon or mars or anywhere more years wont change human nature
hey i dont think have nanobots in the body or the brain will be forced right and i dont think many of this advanced technology happen maybe some of this technology happen but many dont because for money and other things and many countries can have it for poor etc
and aliens will hack this or ai and then the end comes
where everything too simple or automatic
in my opinion i wouldnt do anything about putting anything that hasnt been given to me im years young this is all scary for me to even think about i pray to my god almighty i die before all of this happens
this guy needs ai to help him

its likely that it will be smarter than humans in a very short period of time hang on and dont fall off a lot of pron and cons its going to be interesting to say the least both are endless
the accent sounds like something that will be a thing
when do we get universal basic income
repetative stock video footage
and if people are hooked up to a computer for all of their knowledge theyre not using their brain for what it was they made for to begin with what ever happened to try to excel your brain to be smarter than a computer
a small percentage of the world opposes that thats a good joke
at what year will we know that god exists when will we know where we came from
there is no such thing as genes that cause aging when human cells replicate from the stem cell the copy does not contain the dna that the stem cell used to create it therefore each time a cell replicates it deteriorates which in a word is what is known as aging
is this a way to aliviate poverty disease war all of these proposals cost many billions of dollars the rising costs of things has to be replaced by another currency in addiition stripping the earth of trees plants ways to produce food cannot be replaced what humans have done in terms of space travel fuels our imagination however we cannot be carried away with basic reality like food clothing shelter and companionship humans cannot live in an artificial enviorment robots can robots can assist humans so they wont come incontact with harm the enviorment produces still people have to have goals too not just sitting at a console
i am the future the future is now
each year decade century mankind become more and more advance he feels he do not have a need for god but what happens if a dwarf planet say miles in diameter is right now heading our way from the kuiper belt and there is nothing we can do to stop it these people do not understand that instead of slamming a rocket into an asteroid the best thing would do would be to push it hold it do change the time and the distant from it to earth but i could go on about that

thousands of miles below the surface should be meters not miles the material is very good though
we will never reach this future stage youre talking about tomorrow could be the end of the world

dreamer keep dreaming yourre wrong wait and see
i didnt see telepathic messaging and communication meta was just able to translate brain activity into not only accurate text but actual images in a few years using either a noninvasive device or implanted devices we will be able to communicate using thought even better using implants like neurolink the downside is you could be charged for precrime
ai is easily extenguished by a strong solar storm this has happenned before and it will happen again there are devices that can render a circuit board useless i may need to invest in one
that alredy exist but here it never will bicouse its not place

problem with transferring data using quantum sound is it dont shutup i hear everyones  all the time

thousands of miles below the surface ummm
please slow down and use in moderation

i think we humans can even comprehend the technology of type civilization and your like that that we would have something miles ahed of worm holes and etc our current mind and knowledge and only imagine and say type at best or from type its completely no chance our technologycal singularity would be so byond its

its some pretty likely techs mentioned a couple figures outrageously wrong tho b cost for a space elevator elon would have already if that were the case
about of this video will be true
you spent all this time trying to predict the future and everything you said probably wont happen the people in thought wed have flying cars by now thought wed have free energy by now thought wed have no wars and no one would be hungry or poor but guess what we are exactly the same but with phones in our faces nothing has changed except city people have lost their humanity and turned into internet trolls
if your species human pass the next proof maybe but we cant aloud human to know
im a little concerned that ai will be able to do things and then we wont be able to prove if it was ai that did the crime or if it was a human being that did the crime because if a computer can act just like a person that means it can do crimes just like a person and whats going to stop all of these things from being hacked i cant stop hackers now we have all vehicles controlled by ai or by computers they could be hacked we seen tv shows already about it and weve seen how these computers can take over decide they dont need humans anymore i dont think its right for anyone to make the decision that theyre making when it comes to computers ai or any of it because it isnt the decision of all of humanity its a decision of a few people
god said that towards the end knowledge increase rapidly along with evil the positive side of technology is only half of the equation the bible says that heaven cant be described because we have no frame of reference to understand it i highly recommend you read the bible eternity is a long time to be wrong

man get real were not far from and theres no way ai is gonna be at that point by more like maybe or more around the end of the century america has had a bit of a decline in innovationtechnological advancement major inventions and such these last few years and i dont see much improvement unless we get better leadership otherwise maybe well get there by and beyond but were nowhere near any of this right now and certainly not by
why the irratating music
i dont care what anyone says ai will be the downfall of humanity
and we mustre happy with this is so bad fir humanitas beungtobelive that that fir the good
the time line is a little off we are nocking on the door of what most people think of agi right now at the end of and also we have robots that are almost ready for prime time it looks like to take most factory jobs by about at the latest an tb hard drive becoming main stream not happening today the biggest we can go right now is tb an that is by know means main stream also we are much further with selfdriving than this video thinks we should be for the time there are selfdriving cars working today on the road and wheelers today just not widespread yet but we should have it by s video games can be photorealistic today if they want them to be the agi is already good but not great at acting like the npc its betraying and we where very wrong the first to go was the creative type jobs and there is even an ai ceo out there we are already in the singularity cuz were moving faster than what we could have predicted for example back in the day they would have said we should have a ubi and living the good life by now but we are not so we are very a head of schedule by at least a decade
ok firstly ill go ahead and get my pessimistic predictions of the future out of the way in military industry has reached such levels of greed and apothy that a nuclear war was waged this war known as the the minute war ended all life on the planet earth we know this because of a discovery in archeoligy it appears that these residents somehow lost their abilities to distinguish fundamental differences in their own well established biology culture and societal norms this apparent loss of intellect was brought on by the advent of cancel cultrue thereby taking once intelligent lifeforms and converting them into mindless atomatons that were unable to form their own conclusions about reality out of a fear of being branded a white supremacist and being banned from outside human contact by the rest of their species this resulted in the bringing on of the minute war and subsequent armageddon in the year the term human is slang for anyone mentally unfit for society dont be a human about it thats now the biggest insult one can hurl in a fit of anger the end
jesus christ is returning and will mess up everyones concept of reality thank you

i loved this motivational video it was what i needed to hear this morning thank you
this video came at the exact time thank you
life is not easy sometimes we need inspiration and motivation
to those reading to this here are my extra tips to increase your daily manifestations that ive learned over the years practice gratitude every morning when you wake up list everything that you are grateful for and feel that gratitude in your core feel free to write things down in a journal so it is easy for you to remember replace your negative thoughts with positive ones every time you feel a negative thought coming on make a positive spin on it right away take ownership for things that happen in your life its easy to blame others however you will feel much better when you realize that most issues stem from us always believe that good things are about to happen by being open to new possibilities you are inviting abundance into your life remember that like attracts like so you get back whatever you put out whether it is good or bad so do good and received good meditate for five minutes a day during this time focus on how you want your life to be but place your focus on how you feel and feel that feeling as if you have already accomplished those goals step outside of your comfort zone stop playing it safe and make that decision to finally go for your dreams focus on activities that make you feel truly happy when you are truly happy you have the best vibrational frequency to manifest your desires avoid the naysayers and surround yourself with people who only lift you higher downers will be downers dont let them drag you into their misery dont be afraid to dream and know that you are always supported by the universe hope this helps your friendly neighborhood coach

good vid the reason though people tell college kids to have something to fall back on is because the kids usually pick a worthless degree that they wont be able to get a job in when they graduate one of the biggest scams in history there are certain fields where a college degree is beneficial but for most people its a stupid way to go heavily into debt that theyll struggle to pay back for the next or years while working at something completely different

for the people who see this god bless you and stay safe you are a smart and awesome person
ive heard this many times but it still gives me chills denzels words remind me that faith discipline and gratitude can truly reshape a life
to get something you never had you have to do something you never did
determination persistence and commitment to detail are key factors to longevity and continuous growth in all works of life from my experience anything one gives in time and quality effort always will bring good results even with hassles of the lockdown and loosing a job its surprising new things ive experienced and progress limits i have crossed
when writing the story of your life dont let anyone else hold the pen
put god first was the first thing denzel washington said in one of his speeches i hope that i grow more and more in trusting god and not blindly following success the right place for success should be important to me
the most motivated side of the internet is within these comments
fall forward the two most underrated and motivational words i have heard
very cool ive done something denzel mentioned in this speech a few times i fell forward with nothing to fall back on ive quit jobs that were killing me spiritually physically emotionally financially ive been down and out but i never quit searching i never gave up even when i wanted to and im better off than if i had quit because doors closed but others opened never ever give up denzel is right on he speaks truth here much respect to him for his honesty remember this believe in yourself even when others dont you will gain strength from every small success until youre strong enough to be who you want to be theres a saying those who live in the past are asleep in the present you literally have to become a new person and let the old one go in order to achieve your goals youre still you only a better new improved you
whoever is reading my comment right now just wait on your success because its coming and dont give up
if you dont fail youre not even trying to get something you never had you have to do something you never did

alright alright alright nicely said many ways to see it and say it it does not matter how we got here it only matters that we are here our actions speak louder than words sometimes we have to stop doing what works to find out what works better so many roads that are safe but lead nowhere but circle our safe and sound unaware despair you have always shined so bright thanks mathew i love what you do alright
every day you choose to be better or worse than yesterday choose better and love the process spend the time to love yourself and love your family

things that instantly changed how people treated me i stopped chasing attention i started reading books on selfrespect and presence i quit trying to prove myself to people who dont even matter
i could watch this all day
im still lost but with courage strong enough to keep going i just hope i find my rhythm and my way
i love the message in this video it really resonates with me that were the ones responsible for shaping our future is definitely the year to take charge and make things happen
if youre going to do it do it dive in find out dont half go at it matthew mcconaughey
this hits deep too many people hesitate at the edge of their potential life rewards the bold all in no halfway powerful words from a man who lives them
this speech hit me hard today no more average mindset its time to aim for fortune impact and growth
this hit me hard in a world where its easy to give up on ourselves this is the reminder we all need nobody else can walk our path nobody else can fight our battles and nobody else can live our dreams we owe it to ourselves to keep pushing to keep believing and to keep becoming who we were meant to be isnt just another year its the year we rise
stay in the enjoyment of the doing
yes you reap what you sow but proverbs a mans heart plans his way but the lord directs his steps its not all motivation but if the lord is in it god speed
after watching this im motivated to chase my vision like they owe me money success here i come
life gets heavy sometimes the stress the pressure the selfdoubt it all builds up but this video reminded me that within all that chaos is still a fighter a version of me that refuses to quit thank you for this energy im back in the game stronger than ever
at a big realisation about how t talk to your self sparked in me i knew about healthy talk not beating your self up on your little messes but the examples are what brought me in to how i personally would speak to myself in positive ways as well as negative
is your year you owe it to yourself to grow to hustle and to win matthew mcconaughey just lit a fire in my soul
discipline built my mindset too i share the same lessons on my journey respect
never realized how cathartic it is to listen to matthew mcconaughey we all owe it to ourselves to be able to take it to the next level all of us will fall but we have to get back up and push towards a brighter future
ill be back when ive achieved that goal i strive for everyday i will be back its on me to do what i say to achieve greatness mark my words
you owe it to yourself in because no one else will do it for you your dreams growth and success depend on the choices you make today stay focused stay committed and make this year the one where you refuse to settle
he is one of my favorite living icons that i look up to
so true i totally agree matthew mcconaughey is great
this speech hit hard its not about perfection its about being fully present and owning every step thanks author
if you are responsible in your responsibilitys towards family friends foes more than likely they will respond to you as a son brother father servant worker a friend because your actions and words authenticity of honesty in truth to trust it will give them safety to be secrured in your loyalty of love for them a wife your children or child a father and mother a friend a sister or brother grandpa or grandma a coworker most of all to the best of who you are in this life and the one to come then peace
im not full of myself enough im supportive n gentle with others but not myself enough
you know its kind of weird seeing him matthew on videos in movies knowing how silly he was in the football locker room and all the wild stories he used to tell us its a very fun guy to be around i really ms hey am i wish i would have captain touch that was the best year of high school i ever had was playing football with matthew mcconaughey
not studying ourselves enough thats the answer
discipline beats motivation every time powerful message newbies like me keep growing
im going to make it im going to make myself proud
every time you face what youve been avoiding you reclaim power even one decisive action shifts the internal tide take one step forward power lives there
i know who i am not a quitter
rest it even if all the busyness that we do in life even with all the people we deal with comes a time when nothing else is important but to rest my important soul
small channel gather here we will make it
i will succeed this year and get back to the top
attitude of grattitude
life is a series of good happenings and bad happenings that you can not change you dont have control of that you do have control of how you navigate through those times be selfaware be intentional and have faith that every good and bad thing that happens is an opportunity for something new
its amazing how some people critize me over everything at the same time im cool with whatever they want to do its their life they have their own universal lessons thats none of my business thats between them and god so why are some people all up in my business its amazing they have the time for both
first thing he says in the morning is alright alright alright
like the stoics i believe in showing up each day with discipline and virtue regardless of circumstances external chaos doesnt have to dictate internal peace
thank you it was a very enjoyable experience
the first part from this video actually made me cry when he said you can get off the ride of guilt and regret this one got to me
every great achievement starts with the decision to try
its fascinating how we can be so kind to others but harsh on ourselves this message resonated deeply with me because ive collected stories of people who transformed their lives once they started believing in their own potential to remind others that selfbelief is the foundation of success
his speeches are always the best blessings to anyone and everyone who watches this video and reads this comment own who you are
pray pray pray i promise you jesus is all you need pray and beg for his help he will save you you dont have to attend mass if you cant just praying in your room believe in him
change your thoughts change your life dr wayne dyer i just started a new career and visualized working for this company almost years ago kind of crazy how it actually came to fruition
this speech is something i listen to more than once it helped me out of that lost year old route i found my purpose
ive been through hell and back and been jobless for over years i been making money in other ways but i want to get back on track the right way in days i have a huge job interveiw for a highstakes job that could alter my life path i am looking everywhere and anywhere for inspiration and guidance and here i am
the authenticity of this guy is fantastic
ive been hear this for a week and my life already changed god bless to this man
motivation fades but this this creates momentum
every day i learn something new open minds saves time
mcconaugheys advice on committing fully resonates its like when i finished that personal values questionnaire from whysublime and finally got moving on my goals
amazing this video is truly inspiring and motivating the powerful meaningful words make me feel like nothing is impossible thanks for creating such valuable content
dont destroy your goal for a hole a wise men
i support myself more than ever
this quote gave me chills not just words its medicine for the mind i post similar motivation on my channel every week to lift broken spirits if this moved you my latest short might hit even deeper
im listening to this right before i take my teas for my bsn ive been putting it off for a while but im literally outside of the school in my car staring into my steering wheel
youll regret the chances you didnt take take the risk or lose the chance
you can have excuses or results but never both
i love mcconaugheys voice its no words his way of saying his delivery of words all  good
thankful for this cool ridesending lots of love and positive vibes your way xoxo
if youre reading this right now i just want to say im rooting for you were strangers but that doesnt mean i dont care i know what its like to feel like youre pushing a boulder uphill i felt that way until i picked up manifest the unseen by luna rivers i cant explain it perfectly but it changed my whole perspective after checking it out on youtube and reading it things have been flowingmoney peace confidence maybe this is your moment too stay open wishing you more than you ever imagined
choose it bcoz u want it its on you
yes you can surely do it
i just feel a bit flat but its ok i will keep getting up and rising i wont quit i miss you mum i dont know when i will see you again i still hear you in my head i see you when i fall asleep
wow i was recently diagnosed with mcl thank you matthew you have change my life
this changed my whole day
im here to learn english how many people are like me
i found manifest and receive by eva hartley in the messiest chapter of my life id lost my sense of self and was stuck in survival mode but that book reminded me that receiving isnt passive its permission after checking it out on youtube and reading it ive allowed more love more peace more money without chasing if youre always chasing maybe this is your mirror
i tell my employees this set your sights to the stars team the only risk is falling short and landing on the moon keep in mind thats better than where you are achievements are reserved for those willing to strive for them
i lost my mother when i was and my brother got killed days before my th birthday i never got over it but i promised myself this year i will celebrate surviving in the jungle without them my mother was and my brother was ill be this year i can finally appreciate my life walking across the stage graduating middle school traumatized mefor years for a long time i was tolerated and not celebrated my father started molesting me shortly after my brothers murder i went to a group home after but im saying this to say its never too late my children never got to experience immediate family but they have me it took awhile to even accept that i cant wait to see my success the sky is the limit
simple ways i started creating real change for myself you can learn too i read all books on mindbloomery healthy mindset is the most powerful asset you can own i started by understanding power of assertiveness if you cant communicate clearly you are missing out on big chunk of opportunities i focused on building confidence to speak up even in highly challenging and tough situations people listen when you own your presence
is interesting year to me because i used be a good person but from now on i wont apologize to anybody and i wont accept any apology from anyone if you step on me i will do the same thing step on you im prepared to defend myself verbally physically spiritually if you respect me i will pay back the respect if you hate me i will delete you in my life consider you as a rotten food the place for rotten food is dustbin i must spend these few coming years wisely live for myself not for other people i wasted years tried to made other people happy comfortable now its my time to be comfortable happy
taking you with me as we travel today i practiced on the riverbank of the sacramento river
god makes us good true happiness only comes from god thanks jesus
i didnt need more time i needed more clarity
gratitude in everything
this channel deserves way more recognition great job
a great selfmotivator if you need it just dive in and enjoy the ride
things that instantly changed how people treat me i stopped chasing attention i read books on atruve i stopped trying to prove myself to people who dont matter
a goal without a plan is only a dream always have a plan
if youre reading this right now i just want to say im rooting for you were strangers but that doesnt mean i dont care i know what its like to feel like youre pushing a boulder uphill i felt that way until i picked up manifest and receive by eva hartley i cant explain it perfectly but it changed my whole perspective after checking it out on youtube and reading it things have been flowingmoney peace confidence maybe this is your moment too stay open wishing you more than you ever imagined
no increase the depth of realisation creatively and then deliver the message
this is the stuff i love to listen to gives you something to think of but also allows you to long in wonder and own what you put out and in
thanks from a fellow longhorn
omg i was so surprised when i realized this is the guy from how to loose a guy in days
diddys downfall reminded me that success without healing means nothing found manifest and receive by eva hartley when i was tired of chasing things that didnt feel right since i read it ive been manifesting nonstop unexpected money aligned friendships even small daily things that make life easier everything changed definitely a mustread
mat is the very best of the best thanku for sharing this intelligence
they are right when i get down i take little steps but for me to get back up i have to do things set little holes and i have to do them before i will get to feeling good about myself again so i will feel good about myself again and get back up
can we please appreciate the attention to detail throughout this entire video
honestly it breaks my heart how manifest and receive by eva hartley isnt getting the attention it deserves this book changed me i saw the channel on youtube and my mind was blown people need to wake up to this things have been flowing money peace confidence maybe this is your moment too
i just went back and listened to this once again and feel so much better now

ty for this i really need this after when my dad died it crushed my heart years later my mother died two years ago i feel lost i have children loving loving husband brother sister nieces and nephews who i adore i know what i wanna do and i thank you for this speech
i kept seeing people talk about the dominance formula by atruve and i finally gave in honestly i shouldve read it way sooner this isnt about fake confidence or shouting louderits about real psychological leverage respect control powerits all explained in a way that makes total sense ive read tons of selfhelp and mindset books but nothing cut this deep
im going to rewatch this to make sure i get everything
its wild how someone can have millions and still be so out of alignment a friend recommended me manifest and receive by eva hartley awhile ago when i was depressed since i read that book ive manifested money supportive friendships even small moments of joy that used to feel impossible i feel like im finally receiving what ive always deserved
awesome really motivating
truly a work of art
this video beautifully captures the essence of commitment and the importance of fully embracing our endeavors i particularly resonated with the idea that we often hold ourselves back by halfassing our efforts its a powerful reminder that diving in wholeheartedly can lead to greater clarity about our goals and aspirations how do you personally cultivate the bravery to push past those fears and uncertainties when trying something new
sold me in the first seconds period
is your year to rise not just survive you owe it to you is more than a mantraits a promise to show up for yourself like never before chase your growth guard your peace and embrace your power no more waiting no more settling you owe it to the person staring back in the mirror to dream boldly act bravely and live fully let this be the year you finally become unapologetically you

i listened to nutshell by alice and chains on repeat for just over an hour before watching this video thank you
lifes struggles are not merely obstacles to be endured but the very crucible in which strength character and resilience are forged quotes from great minds like ernest hemingway and oprah winfrey remind us that hardship is a universal experience that develops our inner power and it is in persevering through adversity as confucius and martin luther king jr advocate that we discover our true potential challenges should be viewed as opportunities for growth as albert einstein suggested in the middle of every difficulty lies opportunity embracing the journey of struggle with all its trials is what makes life meaningful and ultimately leads to beautiful destinations the wisdom of figures like maya angelou and ralph waldo emerson teaches us that overcoming these battles reveals who we are and the incredible strength that lies within us transforming our wounds into wisdom and allowing us to rise stronger after every fall
this was a very inspirational and helpful video i highly recommend listening to this and giving it your full attention

if youre reading this right now i just want to say im rooting for you were strangers but that doesnt mean i dont care i know what its like to feel like youre pushing a boulder uphill i felt that way until i picked up manifest and receive by eva h i cant explain it perfectly but it changed my whole perspective after checking it out on youtube and reading it things have been flowingmoney peace confidence maybe this is your moment too stay open wishing you more than you ever imagined
this video was great
this is exactly what i needed today
love the energy in this video
what really blows my mind is how little curiosity people have when it comes to manifestation and the deeper mechanics behind it most folks are satisfied with the recycled quotthink positive and visualizequot narrative which sure has its place but thats just the surface theres a whole architecture of laws and principles underneath that most never even touch the fact that so few have heard of owen hermsting someone who spent years decoding this hidden structure and laid it all out in the law behind the laws says everything people arent necessarily lacking potential theyre just not willing to question beyond the obvious and that comfort zone its costing them their freedom
this is good advice keep the videos coming
motivation is so inspiring and it challenged me and you guys

i blame alot of this negative thinking to our caffeine addiction when drinking caffeine it triggers adrenaline a natrual sense of fight or flight mode to keep you more alert or anxious to prevent danger when your constantly in this state by drinking caffeine you are constantly thinking what if what if to look for or prevent danger this kind of thinking is called anxiety or for some people paranoia now for somepeople caffeine isnt a problem but if your always anxious and you drink caffeine all day everyday the reason for you anxiety is right infront of you in your handcupdrink

absolutely our minds are like a vast universe full of wonders and possibilities one fascinating aspect of the mind is its ability to think and reason we can analyze problemsolve and make decisions based on our thoughts our minds also have the incredible power of imagination allowing us to create and visualize things that dont exist yet its like having a personal movie theater in our heads our minds also store memories both good and bad shaping who we are and how we perceive the world its truly amazing how much our minds can do is there anything specific youd like to know about the mind

touching line the world does not reward mediocrity
focus on your goals u are unstoppable
this video is a understanding of how you cant expect to just sit around and let the world hand you just about anything on a sliver freaking platter it takes commitment hard work steady focusing and hand on responsibility that the ingredients of building a establishment of getting what you really want in life is self
fighting for your ambitions is right thing to do because ur happiness depends upon it
for me staying focused on my goal means keeping my eye on the prize and not getting distracted by obstacles or setbacks its about maintaining a clear vision of what i want to achieve and working towards it with purpose and determination when faced with challenges or temptations i remind myself of my ultimate objective and stay committed to my path by staying focused on my goal i can make progress and achieve success no matter how challenging the journey may be

who else noticed the hunger games sound on the very beginning
reasons to replace cars with trains no traffic no drunk drivers can run on electricity faster
in who knows if many of us will be still alive yet the producers of this documentary have thought about this issue and made a video which can benefit mankind many years to come how noble is this idea
i am just here to learn english edit be i hope we all improved our english so bad
the problem is not how much we put into the atmosphere regarding cars and factories the problem is how many forests we cut down every year
life become more wonderful in videos than in reality
the fact that we are starting to think of different scenarios for the future is hope for humanity
renewable energies natures elements are there to serve but we have to learn to use everything in moderation
life will be just fine well look back to the s wondering how people survived without the new technologies that we have in s
a filipino invented a fuel using merely saltwater but it wasnt supported by the government suddenly news about him and his invention was put into silence
we live near bundaberg in australia here we grow the bulk of our countrys sugar cane unfortunately nobody is making any effort to use our cane to produce ethanol and our cane fields are fast being replaced by macadamia tree farms its only a matter of time before we have to reverse the trend and push back towards sugar cane for ethanol
when i read earth the future of energy what comes to my mind is how the future of the earth
wrong title actual title is transportation in
ill live to the s im curious to see how much change happens and what breakthroughs would be at the cusp at the time
see you in because i will surely come back to this video
few ideas that i got total underground transportation where you can drag the power lines plumbing etc for the cities to look cleanervehiclestrains driving on magnetic fields to reduce the vehicles degradingthis also gives a chance of super fast traveling trains between citiescountries getting energy from getting rid of human feces everything must be recycled and must be recyclable
this is a home app in my school but is nice doc ceep going bbc nat geo documentaries
im just minutes into it praising brasil for ethanol production is like praising the deforestation of the amazon
thanks for this interesting video was so educational about a real thing we are living which is the future we now are in the future but will continue being and unpredictable future about everything
i save this video in watch later list to come back
improvements in the utilizations of world resources
this documentary envisioning a better world in the future coronavirus im about to end this worlds whole career
wow if i hadnt paid so much attention to the documentarys details i wouldnt have been able to get such a real picture of what the future will be like
in the s i thought man in i bet there would be flying cars like the jetsons
someone remind back this documentary in
we dont need technology to survive but we are dependent of nature
whatever it happen i hope shell wont be in charge
this show was presented by shell shell and shell
moral of the story is that humans are never happy with what they have or have built and always want something better or want what their neighbor has because its new and exciting
interesting thoughts
its more like a scene out of mad max beyond thunder dome i imagine
why not harness that big bright thing in the sky i think it has a little bit of energy
it is a matter how we are treating the planets so they will give us something in return
at we are not going to see batteries running trucks tesla
ill come back at to see how much right you were
if they made this documentary now not years ago it was completely different world and technology is changing too fast to predict it
we only evolve as fast as our governments let us its a sick game we need to win
we need more to worry about life with god in here so that we can leave with him eternal we dont leave in earth forever probably most of us the people in the video and those who are watching will die by we are strangers in this world only for short period of time dont worry about earth god is the who take care
in i will be i hope by then we will realize how technology is killing us and we have sense enough to live how they did back in the victorian era of the s when life was so much less stressful and we didnt need apps for everything and when folks had morals values and integrity
title must be the fuel in the future i know fuel is so important in daily life however it is not the only thing to consider for talking about the worlds future
hey it doesnt surprise me theres going to be a great change in every thing every ones life i may not live to see it but its in the coming

polar caps are melting and the oceans are getting deeper and deeper the ocean water contains hydrogen that can be a source of energy ocean water will be the energy fuel in the future
the way you explained this made it so easy to understand
other than the whole thing was an ad for shell it was interesting also when was this made solar costs have fallen so much in the last five years
whats the difference especially with a surplus of people overconsuming on everything were not saving

stop allowing people to have more than children
we not gonna see batteries running large trucks tesla semi truck in hello
lets meet in lets gooo
i totally dig wired magazine that editor is one of my heroes
we are in and the world is about to end
well trying to make car transportation more efficient looks like moving in the wrong direction for me isnt it similar to making more roads and making them wider like if you do it you increase cartravel efficiency and thus move the equilibrium point farther from public transportation it means more people going by cars and soon there will be even more traffic then before but very efficient traffic great what actually could be done to move the equilibrium point to public transport which is much more efficient is optimizing public transportation schemes while getting rid of car roads think about it in terms of equilibrium for a moment but its not commercially profitable so you wont hear this idea from nokia listen to scientists
all nations must cooperate to achieve hunger free disease free world every life deserves the best opportunity to enjoy it fully hope modern tech and science can make it happen soon
this is such a breath of fresh air compared to all the gloomy depressing news were bombarded with on a daily bases
this airport is next my house in brazil so paulo city

clear concise and easy to follow great job explaining
the worst thing for our environment is a new cash crop one that can be turned into fuel for automobiles because of the numbers of trees that will be cut down in order to make way for huge fields of said crop this is a bad bad idea
this is exactly why the rain forest is being depleted i applaud the fact they realize this isnt forever but the destruction we face in the next years before they get and after i gone will they get it
not sure when this documentary was made but some of this stuff is already happening even in my small town amazing how many people are choosing electric cars and solar panels seem to popping up everywhere as are charging stations
such a great and intresting documentaries
to be purposely naive about the political and powerbase control aspect of energy is irresponsible and foolish any number of alternative sources of energy are possible however if they do not serve to fit into and continue the statusquo of geopolitical power they will never see the light of day it should be painfully obvious that peering into the future with ideological eyes and with a utopia mindset will not make it happen plainly if alternative energy does not reap a profit that lines the pockets of the rich then we will all starve and live in the dark
very interesting and inspiring
youre making the assumption well still be around
wat about toilet paper i need my toilet paper

they should just make enormous hive dome cities that are selfcontaining and multiple stories stores and stuff on the bottom stories residences on the upper stories farming on the roof layer solar panels and wind turbines along the outside walls each dome miles diameter and each can hold about to people boom future

battery technology is already exceeding the prediction for in amazing
i cant get over how good the beat drop is
the solution would be to produce fewer people there are too many of us on this planet we as a population dont need to grow we need to shrink less people need less energy produce less waste and co emission need less cattle and farming land and land to live so we can start giving back some to nature
wonder how they plan on replacing all those jobs when they take human beings out of the driver seat glad ill hopefully be dead and gone by the time it really catches on makes me sick
people in this was worst year maybe will be best coronavirus
i remember playing this one pc game that shows what cities will be like on october th mainly just showed it looking like a big scrap yard from a nuclear war
very educative documentary
google the venus project i would build upwards more underground too preferably on steep hills with a view or cliff caves like in the old days and out in the oceans
then theres the vast forms of recycling
i have this for homework hahah
i am not trying to be negative by no means rather i am trying to look at this realistically they said we will have flying cars in the st century and no longer depending on fossil fuels and petroleum we got these hybrid cars that are not bad but not what we were promised dont get me wrong flying cars do exist but its in the experiment phase and has been for years problem is the people trying to work on these flying cars cant seem to figure out how to keep it stabilized they can get it off the ground and float but not very high we as a species of people are a type civilization we are still in the infancy stage of developing the technology of harnessing our planets energy if you are curious about what im talking about with then go research levelstypes of civilization sorry i dont know the proper scientific term we might become a type civilization in the next years however we will never get there while we are still divided by governments unless we come together as one government we have to give up the ideology that one is better then the other based on color race social status gender ect
wow this changed my perspective great job
i just wondered whether it is possible to extract heat from the surrounding air to produce energy in airconditioning system kw input into the air conditioning system can produce kw of heat output using this heat to boil a volatile liquid as such refrigerant will produce enough gas to drive a turbine to produce energy possibly larger than the input energy energy is not conserved here as the system is not totally enclosed the result is a system that will cool down the environment and at the same time produces electricity mathematically it works but i have no chance to test it practically the principal is the same as using geothermal energy accept this is extracting energy from the surrounding air instead of underground water
wow just in my lifetime from to years i have seen a lot of changes some for the better and some for the worse in my lifetime ive went from a transistor am only radio to what we have today from small grocery stores to mega stores that sell everything from a to z from unleaded gas for cars to electric cars from only fans to cool a home to ac in of all homes here in the usa from where you could tell the difference between a man and a woman to trying to figure out the gender of who you meet from not locking your doors whether your home or car to not daring to leave a door unlock for fear of theft or death from trusting a police officer to fearing them from not hearing about environmental problems to hearing about the detriment of mankinds greed ruining the earth on a daily basis to advancement in health technology and space travel being done by leaps and bounds imagine what will happen in the next years i hope its a far far better world than what it is now
we are not going to see batteries running large trucks thats when i stopped watching
your life looks so exciting thanks for sharing
when we talk about the future of transportation there are three main factors gas or electric and body iron so we must keep in mind that nature reproduce gas and electric but not iron iron is limited and target of most construction and transportation therefore the good idea for future transportation is to has smaller cars or expand share transportation this way saving more on time road construction and saving iron it self for other construction iron reproduction naturally is very slow or not at all think about it in the future of not really long earth run out of iron and the speed of ironic products are triple of right now earth and life can be destroy by humans them selves if careless about the future coming events of technology and transportation construction
not possible to power without fossil fuels two words nuclear energy
did anyone ask people if they want to live like that i sometimes feel that we are not even being asked i dont want technology to take over us
batteries will certainly not power the trucks of the future tesla semi truck hold my charger
why isnt thorium molten salt nuclear reactors mentioned as a viable energy source for the energy in the future the technology was shown to be effective by the s or s it was developed by the same man who developed the uranium nuclear power plants and he was against using uranium but was in favor thorium which is much saver and cheaper than the other forms of energy because it will no contribute to adding carbon dioxide to the atmosphere and the radiation is the same as background radiation of the earth
this is where tesla battery packs comes into play for storing energy for the night time
its so good to see a positive outlook instead of all the negativity we are fed and experience throughout the globe especially the last couple of years with so many squalid things that surround us epidemics wars poverty starvation social and political turmoil injustice and negative vibes the most significant element that can save us is love we as species must realise that without love compassion and empathy we are all doomed if we understand that we are all connected as a universal soul without any borders then we can thrive imho may all mankind find the light within which is the divine love and then glowing hearts and souls will unite in harmony and peace into a glorious future ahead
this guy said were not going to see diesels powered by electricity this man clearly as never heard of nikola there is also companies working on electric aircrafts so already this documentary is blown out of the water lmfao

nice post love from india
we need way more trains and buses than cars selfdriving trains and buses would be really good this is a big part of a meaningful solution not what they are saying here that they dont say this is extremely backward thinking and disappointing having underground selfdriving trains and buses using the most environmentally friendly way possible to get around would be excellent
cultivating land for biofuels is a crime
you will certainly not see a truck or a plane powered by electricity we already have both
not world in just fuel you aint talk about  but fuel
i think these are good ideas but solar and batteries are going to rule the world soon

your not going to see batteries running large trucks tesla just maybe and still years to go
this thing is flawed from one end to the other most of our green technologies are actually worse for the environment but really look back years to you can walk down the street then and now and see little difference other than what is in style the look of the cars and clothes and such you might see fasterbetter electronics and maybe more electric cars if battery technology improves a lot there are not going to be flying cars powered armor jetpacks laser rifles cloning cybernetic implants and the pollution is not going to force us all to live in dome cities
i m aatching this video after years and now is
on a race against god he has won since day turn to him
hate the propaganda more propaganda than real information come on the elites absolutely expect all cars to drive themselves in short order no more than years most hope to get it done in

judgment day is here dream big but remember to do good
the research which was funded in part by the national wildlife federation and u s department of energy found that ethanol is likely at least more carbonintensive than gasoline due to emissions resulting from land use changes to grow corn along with processing and combustion feb
the world wont be here in with trump being the president
the world wont be much different a lot of frustrated wouldbe inventors including myself will continue to struggle financially wont start families and be forced to take our ideassecrets to our graves due to over a century of corrupt patent laws and the resulting lack of cooperation
carl sagan said it best there is no hint that help will come from elsewhere to save us from ourselves
my predictions although i wont be alive to see many of them quantum computing up and running all new cars must have self drive functionality petrol and diesel cars become a dying breed nobody except petrolheads wants them since battery range increased dramatically us mars mission fails horribly with the manned space probe heading towards deep space with no fuel left to turn around after an explosion crew of to perish first desktop quantum computers rolled out offering times the speed of conventional laptops completely lifelike graphics now available in real time vr a chinese ship lands on mars dumb household robots now commonplace dumb household robot becomes aware and murders family first lifelike robot introduced and fools many on its first night out on the town its against the law not to have asimovs laws programmed in first download of human mind to computer man sets foot on pluto well in fact its a robot with a human mind onboard mars now a tourist hotspot thanks to the em drive first flyby of probe past planet orbiting proxima centauri very interest pictures massive breakthrough in space technology allowing speeds of of the speed of light to be achieved for large ships immortality guaranteed for those who can pay for it and actually want it first manned yes real humans landing on the exoplanet around proxima centuari the first lines of the triumphant mission arrive back on earth before being abruptly cut off following a scream nasa remain silent all future maned missions cancelled pending a flyby a flyby of the exact landing area shows no sign of the craft or crew no more pictures are transmitted as the probe mysteriously goes dead earth surrounded by ships of an unknown type

if i alive ill watch again in inshaallah
the world is evolving very fast
the most interesting thing is that in reality there are no shortterm solutions there are still many theories but nothing effectively useful to solve the energy crisis
i dont know i think the most important resource we need to survive is water and not the fuel for so many personal cars i my country we wanted to start an action and to plant many new trees but we were met with the refusal of ecologists at first we were really utterly surprised but then we were explained that for planting a certain number of plants we have to make sure that we have the required amount of water supply i may be wrong but i think the nuclear energy is the only way out provided the scientists will find the way to make it much less dangerous and we have to cut down our mobility and travelling trains planes and cars in the first place tourism may turn out to become one of the greatest ecological problems even the ecotourism many people gathered at one place are very likely to bring about some issues
whats about generating a system that guides the number of vehicles that should be allowed on a specific route it also may help the authorities regulating traffic
orijinal name of the documentary is earth the future of energy it was released in
leaving my comment to see whats really going on come
great knowlege keep it up
anyone else notice that the solar energy system about minutes in looks a lot like the schist disk
why dont we use compressed air to help run cars
you forgot that after world war warp speed is invented and st contact with other civilizations is made live long and prosper
well minutes in and all their predictions have been disproved electric cars trucks and aircraft are already here not bad for years
my child if you are watching this that mean its future and your father is now year old near to death i hope you have a happy life and most important that if you found this message it mean technology is on its peak i hope that you will be my great son

editor for the wired acclaimed film makers
thought this is what the world would be like in instead its a video on global warming and fuel
remember when we use to watch the jetsons back in the day
this video was really well made and super informative however i cant help but wonder if the predictions about climate change are a bit overly optimistic seems like we might be underestimating how fast things are deteriorating
i forecast small simple houses no more cars growing our own food less consumerism animals being free i think its called little house on the prairie
algae is a good source and is about oil all you have to do is squeeze it out
in norway we have lots of big electric trucks and buses
i hope i will make it to see u all then
we are in nothing has changed
so what is the point of making corn ethanol it takes as much energy to produce as the energy you get
they cant even predict whats gonna happen tomorrow and here they are talking about
flow battery technology is missing in this video but interesting view
i will be back in to compare the progress
got an actual shell ad
probably if the pandemic havent wreck havoc to the world and now everything is unpredictable you live now and you will never know what will happen next
the plant that have been extracted sugars can also be grind even further to powder form if necessary and chambered to fungus that grind also then mixed with water and let to ferment making ethanol from fibers of sugarcane leftovers this will not be limited to sugarcane alone but variety of plants including maize stocks leaves stem after harvesting if you jew maize stocks you will test sugars and increased on maize stems as the stem turn more into reddish color than greenish tho more greenish the soil is fertile their and good yield for maize as a cereal but instead of burning like indians do among other counties we can extract ethanol from those fibers the cows that feed on this hay after harvest of cereal including rice those cows we can grind their hay to powder form so to eat less and create a room for ethanol with the some resource research on best technic to grind this hay to powder may be pillared by bones grinding machine speaking of bones grinding how on earth do we allow people in kenya buttery to sale bones to public kwani watu ni doggy and when you buy meat with bones since you will only eat meat and throw away bones that implies your price of meat is inclusive bones so if you only pay for meat your price in relation to meat will remain unchanged those bones should be grinned and chambered inside a container with bone grinding bacteria found in marabou stork as additive to fertilizer and animal feeds at marabou grinned food efficiency will increase and plants will not strain to find calcium hence more and good quality hay leftover after harvesting cereals for our ethanol milking
this video title is not good but inside contents lovely
the question isnt is this applicable the question is should we do this because everytime we manipulate something in nature for our needs genetic manipulation something horrible happens every time
please upload with english subtitles
at the minute mark it is stated that you get out times the energy you put in but research shows me that it is only times the amount what am i not understanding here maybe the difference between sugar cane and sugar
so for the past yrs weve known oil wasnt a infinate resource and causes globle warming and suddenly now were in a race to find an alternative fuel source and why
th april i will comeback in
what about using capacitors or rechargable batteries to use at night divert some of the sunlight to rechargable batteries or capacitors through the day to be able to use at night problem solved
nice things we can expect in
if i m alive i ll be back in
that thumbnail is definitely will b nowhere near lookin like that
i look at the ameca humanoid robot and i think we will be even further along in than shown in this documentary
he said in we wont have electric air flight or electric big trucks but we have those now
the title of this is misleading considering all it talks about is fuels and future vehicles i was expecting more of a post alien intervention reality time and space travel should be the norm in
i am here to learn english but the video is very good too
batteries wont be running trucks tesla hold my beer
so this is just the longest shell gas commercial in history basically
i could make it to hopefully i do
this is only years old and they already have trucks that are powered by batteries
question why do we need cities for the matrix
balik ako dito pag
the world in lets talk about suger for an hour
one day everyone that has died will be on the earth so most of the plans are not putting that into account
in the future like in this video it will be amazing and look interesting and perfect
what you need is extensive research in magnetic technology and get out of the mindset of fossil fuels and burning carbon
im from ill be back here in and what will i be in that year
seems almost quaint here in autumn
mate public transport this looks more like a video on how to save car industry
the problem is population decline not population bomb especially in the countries that worry about it
i would rather see an asteroid destroy this planet than to imagine a horrific future such as this monstrosity
the title should read a possible future of earth the real future indicates that nothing can change and that only they are right even though many things they thought were facts have been proven wrong
in the world will be full of luxury apartments that no one can afford large numbers of unemployed due to ai and a few super rich who live isolated from the rest
before earth dies lets see what resources we can find in witkleigat in south africa
its lets see what happens in if we make it
comment kore gelam a jate sobai amar comment dekte pare
trima kasih sudah menayangkan kehidupan manusia di tahun kalau saya boleh usul bisa ga pbb mengadakan hari libur buat hari jalan jadi manusia di seluruh dunia luangkan dalam satu tahun sehari saja untuk tidak menumpangi kendaraan kecuali yang darurat
if a smaller carbon footprint is the goal why are automakers building larger automobiles also it might be beneficial to make the downtown areas of cities pedestrian areas while also utilizing electric monorail and tracked transportation systems like they use in europe and american cities like sacramento ca people do not need two or three cars sitting in front of their houses also we need to look into using natural gas or propane for fuel
work at this yeast production for enough years you may successfully engineer a horse
terima kasih infonya
iam i will not see i hope to only see one can only hope things will improve for humanity but i have my doubts lol
both ethanol and gasoline put out about the same amount of co per gallon this does not count the additional co it takes to make and transport the ethanol take care with your data
i love it so much and i dont know what to say
i am from the future and we have found a solution by a man named elion musk
i weep for the future
i thought this was a conversation asking our options for the future but this is basically a documentary about how our future will look like in continuing within the same financial commercial confinements so much less interesting
the only sustainable avenue would be to leverage the sun energy the other options are no viable avenues in the long run
please tell me it is a science documentary or another
i thought the line and the cube would be the future
will be the hunger games throughout the world
i thought we were so smart and will go back to wild life and but okay wondering how the water will taste in
why cant cities and suburbs be designed with internal public transportation to our shops markets and work to get to it would reduce the number of vehicles on the road and it would be cheaper
billlion and im here in
i think u r forgetting butterfly effect according to this effect it is impossible can predict
year smell of brimstone the sound of silence too dark for sight
so what creates the electricty to which you refer that will power the future
ill be back in years to see if you were right
i will come to look this again if am rich in wealth and health
o mais interessante que na realidade no existem solues a curto prazo ainda existem muitas teorias mas nada efetivamente til para resolver a crise energtica
trade secrets prevent consumers from enjoying cheap energy
how about home swapping to allow people living closer to their worksites
i would never go to mazda if i couldnt drive driving is what i love to do
wellcoming the renewable energy revolution congratulations mega thanks
i thought ethanol uses way to much to makewater good water peoples life saving water
i see many cars and many people going in the same direction why then not invest in quality public transportation and reduce the number of cars on our roads and promote a bit of walking exercising for short distances
will not have large infrastructure revolutionized it can only have some advanced technologies applied in limited areas it is just impossible to invest so much money without enough profits for investors
what happened to the solar car who made it go away
years time i will be years old
the problem with ethanol fuel is that people will drink and drive too much
the energy crisis solution is simple reduce the distance people need to move every day
there are electric trucks and i think they recently invented an electric airplane
it is very useful video
smythos ai is a doubleedged sword it offers immense potential for progress but also poses significant risks if not developed responsibly smythos
nobody talks about what shell did to nigeria the environment doesnt matter to them only money does
however covid will leads to another world by apart from the one mentioned in this video across the globe many have become vulnerable and striving to survive fuel usage of automobiles comparatively got reduced due to covid protocols in developing countries
entertaining basiclly not equally on the points given how much wilderness of trees filtering out polutaince how much c is in the atmosphere which is not even near how long does it take too see a difference and how much will it cost water is the most abundant resource on the planet hydrogen before teera forming the moon howabout bringing life too are deserts lets skip a war or two and spend a trillon building new futureistic power plants
the thumbnail says it will make you question everything thats including the podcast
i will come in and see if i learn english or not
hi watching from year
who actually believes that converting food into fuel is a viable solution
i dont know what to say but i felt that scientists are great in their logical farther thinking beyond what is seen but whats the ironical here is that a lot of scientists who dream of future here was seemed to be much older so i wonder if they will be able to live for my mouth is still open
the famous future changes to the world of past
anyone notice that we havent had any new inventions since the internet
were not going to see batteries power large trucks in comes ghe tesla semi
october lets see how close it goes years later
he stayed for twentyeight years i am waiting
always sceptical when a global oil company decides to shape the future in their favour undoubtably
where tf did that shell commercial come from
so how do rural areas fit into these ideas all we hear is city city city some of us dont want to live in the city we like the freedom of owning land in a rural area do they take ideas from common people in rural areas or is it just city folks
talking about efficiency in road use and reducing fuel consumption is but a dream corporations are making tons of profits from these problems which are problems for the consumer but profit for the oil producers modern day corporation strategy is to first create a problem and then offer a solution for pay corporations subsidize research and they will only pay for inventions and innovations which will bring return of investment so the future in will look exactly the same as in with few more gimmicks in entertainment and no substantial change in the society
if people who so this prediction had something important to loose then i would probably consider believing them
gotta get to the future first
i will come back in years and we shall see
car centric cities or countries has huge problem in traffic today why not utilizing exciting infrastructure for example buses trains but we also need to make commuters safe in traveling drivers of this exciting infratructure should drive safe in safe speed and also people should respect each other thats including not to steel or taking advantage from newbies tourist foreigner immigrants rookie and so on we should change our mind set and relationship by mind conditioning to respect each other that we need to change for a better future in additional to this i also acknowledge the negativity of desperation of lower class citizen in those countries too police must enforce properly senators or law makers should be properly work as they should be not for their political wins thats short term only change mindset to respect each other is also our way for the future
as of rn i view as a year having full of tall buildings in rich countries and advance technologies and more rich people around the world i dont see any flying cars and people going to mars hell naw
now go compared this to earth made in and see if you can find any similarity
so if ethanol is so great why is it so much more than petroleum
bro if you are making robotics trucks to follow each other with same speed and distance to reduce air drag why not go for trains man the meg lev one
watching this before the ends
its called the sixth great extinction not if but when
in we already billion population so you guys were mistaken in calculation
it is very interesting
please talk about ecosia they are a search engine that plants tress
early projections stated we would have flying cars in this present time of our existence so far it hasnt happened
did they not say this years ago though wired magazine still exists
wth why does it start with the hunger games theme song
i will be here in
learn from creation geese fly in a v formation to reduce wind drag all vehicles have to drive in very close synchronization very much like railway cars in a train able to join the train and leave the train at any point along the route lower fuel cost with freedom to drive where please
why am i watching this after the covid pandemic fiascosurprise
we dont have to have cars and cell phones
future and then hunger games music at intro
do you think the gold in the near future still can be use for jewellery or it will be forbidden and preserve to use for something bigger my question is sound stupid but i mean it
why is it so long like it had the time of random min vids
drive up to busta dollar and drink your ass off whew like i always say if ya cant drink doing it it aint worth doing
people should not worry about carbon emissions rather we should worry about how we destroy our natural rainforest and destroy the entire ecosystem you can burn fossil fuel and everything that emits carbon but still without natural forest we are as good as doomed
ill be back to laugh at this comments
will it be sustainable
now it is now we can see self driving vehicles in many countries
looks like this was sponsored by shell i am sure it is not biased
we will not see batteries run large trucks elon musk hold my beer
i dont go for that greta thunberg bs but i do like the fact that theyre trying to do more with renewable energies renewable energy defiantly is going to continue growing
in ill be years old
maybe if hes engineers and other executives didnt demand such high salaries then the price of drugs would be lower
public transport is the future not cars
ah yes the year where we have a buttplug scrapers
im gonna be old by then
lol it exists already big electric trucks even lumber trucks which have double the power of a regular combustion engine and buses regardless of what substances you might thin as long as you burn them well that will result in co emission there are even electric big jumbo planes that are electric powered with a hydrogen reactor people will have to look into the future if they want to have success but business always will look in to keeping a technology as long as possible
very nice docu but i really think masdar city is the future we in europe have a big problem with our citys
the opening seine was wrong we most certainly will see semi trucks and airplanes that do not take liquid fuel fossil fuel is going to be like steam power is today history
meanwhile we build hp cars
wrong we dont need cities small communities are enough in the area of hyper loop
yah in the s they told us wed have jetpacks and teletransporters by im still waiting
is years away
good morning po from the philippines
you cant live by destroying nature if you are on earth then the boss is nature you will see my son
when at the beginning they are like battery powered trucks and planes are improbable or impossible and its only years later had to check the date then im like playing devils advocate thinking not much has really changed in terms of efficiency for mass transit and infrastructure in the last years so what really could be accomplished in peace time by
thats impossible nostradamus said the world would end as we know it in the year
they are forgetting to add the most crucial element the wealthy
what about people in are there any
if you are not in the financial market space right now you are making a huge mistake i understand that it could be due to ignorance but if you want to make your money work for you prevent inflation from eroding your savings build generational wealth and cultivate good habits and financial knowledge you must be in the market
things have really changrd from years ago we use ev car in daily bases bio ethanol havent heard that term for years are we still using it
sugar cane is a horrible idea for fuel because its limited based on weather to cold it dies to hot it dies now it cane grow in degrees but places like here in texas it can get well over that and even hotter with heat index it can only be grown in limited places and one bad year and we are out of fuel
love this so interesting to watch and very helpful and informative
where are the sources
so i literally had a random thought if we already had electric cars and gas ones why dont we try to develop a car that can be used from water or air thus making it where air polution is lowered but the cost for it to be made could be high but it would maybe fix global warming idk just hear me out this came from a yr old so am i right or wrong
what would we do without our boffins and gogetters
hi dear i hope everything things is ok my opinion for dacomentre he is really good i like dear
i believe someday water can be converted into a fuel
in there will be max billion people
i will be a senior by then if i live
going to be manifestation of angelic being
a i is the most dangerous thing than you think elon musk
guess they didnt consider elon musk batteries and motors
we just need to chill and live we have become machines ourselves causing stress and wars we killing off the humanity and dont even realize it
brazil good for producing sugar cane mexico good for producing coke caine
yes the by product of fermentation they dont address is co then burn it what is the by product co the only solution is hydrogen or electric any co in engines doesnt work even if it is more efficient we have to sacrifice
am now am sure i wont make to i will be gone before
hey can i use some clip of this video for my channel with out copyright claim
sir we are use solar hit energy so that no carbon are produce plese looks at that
dreamer you aint nothing but a dreamer you gotta get it through your head oh no
the future of personal transport is fully autonomous electric fleet vehicles uber is already onto this an electric autonomous vehicle eliminates all the roadblocks if all cars are autonomous there will be no need for stoplights or traffic signs the vehicles will simply drive through an intersection at a slower speed communicating with each other and never stopping road speed will be slower and travel times shorter there will be no need for personal ownership you just book a vehicle with your smart device and it turns up and takes you door to door and without labor costs it will cost the same as a public transport fare you dont have to wash it service or fill it up just book it electric autonomous flying vehicles could work the same way and we could eventually eliminate roads altogether and probably public transport networks as well
i hope to come back and reply to this comment in
i wish i could be born in future
planet earth peace love
how about we stop for once in making more vehicles and let humans to rely more on only the use of public transportation doing this will put more of the land spaces for more housing and amenities humans needs homes to live in and homes needs lands adjustment to humans populations is needed more education for development to down size populations by increasing understanding to family planning
seems like this video isnt aging well the extreme inovation in battery tech will definately allow for nearly every truck and airplane powered by batteries
the biggest problem on the planet today is how to find solutions to problems while feeding corporations and their never ending thirst for profits every problem has a simple solution if you dont have billions of bureaucrats and freeloaders who are sucking on the feeder consuming resources without producing anything useful for the progress of the humanity to make matters worse they are not just consuming they are actively hindering everything with regulations demands for profitability and inventing new problems
was the snap thanos
does anyone remember alan toffoler if my spelling is correct future shock any similarities to recent documentaries and books that one can make constructive predictions leave comments no censorship
la tecnologia non generatore di felicit
but why i saw an video with billion views
its starts with the executive editor at wired magazine who appears to be and acts like a young boy as one well into his th decade of life i find thats an odd opening to a documentary
this will not be the world in folks pipe dreams it will ve a dystopian nightmare like its already heading in that direction
helen and john are defiantly robots made by shell
im at a loss to understand how the fact earth is a big ball of molten rock from which might be drawn a virtually limitless quantity of energy so rarely ever features in the debate around energy and climate the underlying assumption there are limits to growth does not seem to hold given the sheer scale of the heat energy of the earth converted to electricity and hydrogen and used to meet human energy needs carbon free plus desalinate irrigate recycle and capture carbon plugging into the planet we can continue to grow into the long term future
today is i am studant that language english lets to start a new language
seriously sure can tell who you stand with pun intended
still waiting on the amc squeeze
pray for gods return before this
there are fully electric cars now thanks
let me see if these assumptions will be true on inshaallah
its not the cars chicago needs more subway trains for people can go anywhere by subway like new york
excellent documentary
this is cool and all but what happens if there is a power cut people are too reliant on technology i see everyone panicking no back up plan in place
we should have been working on bio fuels in the damned s are u kidding
how do they know how is will be
this part of the video did not age well at all lol now we have companies like tesla coming out with electric cars and causing other companies to hop on the band wagon then we have nikola which is trying to create electric trucks and now other companies are on the verge of making electric planes as well as use drones as air taxis since they are now more main stream
i think its ridiculous to look at the year without admitting that we should have conquered mass production of hydrogen by using bioreactors or coal gasification systems both will efficient make significant quantities of hydrogen fuel after all it is the most abundant molecule in the universe so start investing
i will not be here in but regret by others curitiba paran brasil
is bad enough i don t even think about jesus
have yall found changes lols rn
has geometrical shapes
a minute in batteries will never work this didnt age well
will see if we alive in
gas station whent for electrons
lol this movie is totally nonsense everyone know that feature belongs to china and russia
nice video good thing to know were alive on beyond alleluia amen o y
in the i will be years old thats  that
do not skip covid time population deaths
okay ethanol is not the future is not the solution i would argue that it is worse for the environment due to the fact that it takes so much land to grow that takes away wild spaces for animals and enjoyment in general
tani gina klasehan man ta danay noh hindi nga puro mu ni gina tan aw ta tas hatag reflection hshshshshsh
yrs later no electric semitrucks wrong
the world should be focusing on doing something like the venus project but we still fuckin around
be right back in dueces
society if eddsworld never existed
it will be almost the same and feel extremely deprived of any progress
in the population will reach billion not
bro theres already tesla
your channel is a highly underrated gold mine of knowledge thank you
documentary is over years old
